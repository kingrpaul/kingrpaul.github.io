<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>When Mr. T. Smith, the prominent stockbroker
of Capel Court in the City of London, woke that
morning, the sun was streaming into his comfortable
bedroom in a respectable quarter of the
region north of Hyde Park. He felt a curious
sense of exhilaration, a strange glow of happiness. Like a boy
who knows he has done well in an examination, he experienced
a delightful, light-hearted anticipation. And this glow pervaded
his whole being. It was as if he expected some happy event,
a piece of luck, a glorious stroke of chance.</p>
<p>He could not define it, but he felt that it was there, almost
within his grasp. So vivid was this happy emotion that he
sprang from the bed and stood in his striped blue and white
pyjamas, staring out of the open window. The sun on his bare
neck was hot, birds were singing in the mangy cedar of the
small garden, a few early hyacinths blazed just below him in a
narrow strip of green. But he saw nothing to account for what
he felt. The sparrows were dirtier than ever.</p>
<p>He was puzzled. Tightening the belt of his pyjamas which
had become loose in sleep, he smoothed his scanty hair and
rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Had a dream, I suppose,&quot; he mumbled to himself. &quot;A
jolly dream sometimes does the trick,&quot; he added, opening his
jacket wider to let the sun warm his scraggy chest. Only, he
could not remember any dream.</p>
<p>Mr. T. Smith liked things explained properly, and this
bright happiness lay beyond his explanation. It had nothing
to do with his business, nothing to do with the buying and selling
of shares. He knew that instinctively. His business was
good, but it was not as good as that!</p>
<p>He stroked his bare chest and smiled. Something important
was going to happen to him. He felt it in his bones. It was
something that might alter his whole life. But of what
kind, he asked himself, opening another button, and staring
fixedly at the milkman in the area.</p>
<p>So methodical was Mr. T. Smith, so regular in his life, that
this stir of emotion upset him rather. His business, inherited
from an uncle, was steady and lucrative. &quot;Mr. T. Smith and
Co.&quot; was respected in the City. It was a family business, his
clients too respectable to allow of mistakes. They lived and
died prepared ‚Äî by Mr. T. Smith and Co. Irregularities played
no role. His quarters in North London were also eminently
right. His landlady, Miss Slumbubble, had looked after him
for twenty years. She even mended his clothes; added new
pockets when his money, wearing holes, slipped through. The
first time, he remembered, the new pocket was too deep, so
that his hand dipped to his knee to find a coin. But that was
years ago.</p>
<p>Withdrawing from the open window, where the milkman
watched him with too much interest, he thought, Mr. T. Smith
dressed and went down to breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;You 'ad a good night?&quot; asked Miss Slumbubble as usual,
bringing the invariable eggs and bacon. &quot;You slep' well, Mr.
Smith?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better than ever, thank you, Miss Slumbubble,&quot; he replied,
also as usual. He wondered if she noticed the excitement that
still burned in him like a flame. He hoped not.</p>
<p>Apparently she did not. &quot;That mattress,&quot; she observed,
&quot;is the best in London. And I always make your bed myself,
Mr. Smith.&quot;</p>
<p>She had said this every morning for the past twenty years,
and Mr. T. Smith knew exactly the reply she expected. &quot;I
thought you had.&quot; He produced it with a smile, and began to
eat his eggs.</p>
<p>Only Miss Slumbubble could not know with what curious
excitement he had sprung from the &quot;best mattress in London&quot;
an hour ago, nor with what a strange sense of anticipatory
happiness he started forth upon his day. He put his impeccable
tie, if possible, straighter, he tugged at his moustache, he took
his umbrella, he set forth. &quot;I feel a bit of a dog, you know,
this morning,&quot; he caught himself saying under his breath ‚Äî
then turned sharply, for Miss Slumbubble stood behind him.
She invariably saw him off to the City.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! Good-bye, Miss Slumbubble,&quot; he exclaimed as usual.
&quot;I shall be back by seven o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And your dinner will be ready for you, Mr. Smith,&quot; replied
the landlady, also as usual. &quot;And I 'ope it won't rain.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Smith paused before making his customary comment.
As a rule he said &quot;I trust not,&quot; but this morning the words
refused to come as they had always come before.</p>
<p>&quot;It <em>can't</em> ‚Äî to-day,&quot; he heard himself saying.</p>
<p>But the door slammed behind him as he said it. He heard
the bang. He was not sure whether Miss Slumbubble had
caught his words or not. He laughed to himself. He pulled
at his moustache. Usually, it felt soft, but now, he noticed, it
felt stiff and wiry. It bristled, rather. He laughed again and
set forth briskly to walk across the Park to his office. He had,
after all, forgotten his umbrella. &quot;Something's wrong with
me,&quot; he chuckled to himself, &quot;or ‚Äî perhaps ‚Äî it's something
right.&quot; He laughed outright. &quot;Anyhow, it's ‚Äî <em>different</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, as he strode along, he suddenly recalled that Miss
Slumbubble had made an unusual remark to him. His mind,
occupied with something else at the moment, had not noticed
it. Now it came back to him. When he said it could not
rain to-day, her comment was unexpected.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, she would have said that &quot;she oped not.&quot; This
morning she said another thing: &quot;Anything may 'appen,&quot;
were the words she used.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything,&quot; agreed Mr. T. Smith, laughing so happily
that, as he crossed Bayswater Road into the Park, he nearly
got run over.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ii">
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Following the routine of years, he strolled across the Park,
intending to take a 'bus eventually at Trafalgar Square. But
to-day he felt a strange reluctance to go to his office.</p>
<p>He fought against this, for what would people say if Mr.
T. Smith was late? He had never been late. His reputation
was based upon his punctuality. His clients would talk. Even
Miss Slumbubble might hear of it. It would never do if he
dawdled.</p>
<p>&quot;Bother Miss Slumbubble!&quot; he suddenly exclaimed.
&quot;And hang my clients! What does it matter if I am late!&quot;</p>
<p>All the way something was singing in his heart. Perhaps
it was that the spring was running in his blood. For now, at
last, the spring had really come. Late in May the sun had finally
struggled out, and the endless winter seemed to be gone for
good. He saw a swallow darting past a chimney. A whiff of
warm, scented air blew over him. He thought of gorse and
pine trees on some sandy waste ‚Ä¶ of lizards ‚Ä¶
butterflies. ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>He knew suddenly that it was something more than the
spring. His whole being thrilled to a new rhythm. Someone ‚Äî
somewhere ‚Äî had piped and he had heard. The real
man had answered.</p>
<p>Not Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court, but the other one ‚Äî
Tornado Smith.</p>
<p>For he now abruptly remembered that he was named
Tornado. Mr. T. Smith, most people thought, was Thomas
Smith, even Timothy Smith, but actually his first name was
Tornado. And surely he was not called Tornado for nothing!</p>
<p>It was the half-named Tornado that heard the queer piping
and answered to it, the part of him that, against all judgment
and reason, drove his little sailing boat out of the safety of the
harbour into the wintry gales of his brief holidays ‚Äî Tornado,
the adventurer that underlay the man of business, the part
of him that took wild, even ridiculous, risks from time to time.
It was just this &quot;something&quot; belonging to &quot;Tornado,&quot; that
made him different from the jostling thousands he passed daily
on his trudge to his office in the City.</p>
<p>Some spring, some bubble, danced now in his heart, discovered first,
it seemed, in sleep.</p>
<p>His steps, unconsciously, became slower and slower. He
found himself regretting that he could name no valid excuse
for not turning up at the office. At every opportunity he paused
and looked about him. He studied the shop windows with the
closest attention, as if he had never seen them before ‚Äî anything
to prolong his walk. He was waiting for something. But what
that &quot;something&quot; was he had no idea.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Tornado</em>,&quot; he repeated to himself with a new feeling of
its significance. As though his father had been a whirlwind,
his mother a storm. It made him laugh, as he dawdled on,
staring at this and that, idling, drifting, waiting ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Still, it was not till he had reached Trafalgar Square that
he came definitely to a halt. The office seemed suddenly more
than he could bear. He stopped dead. Something plucked
at his heart. He watched the pigeons drinking at the fountains.
He was very late already. He knew quite well that his secretary,
with a bundle of tiresome letters, was fuming and fussing; clients
were wondering why Mr. T. Smith was late. The telephone
was ringing ‚Ä¶ ringing ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>&quot;Well, let it ring!&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;And let the
secretary wait! And let the clients wonder why I'm late!
It'll do them all good!&quot;</p>
<p>He lingered in the warm sunshine, watching the pigeons
preen themselves after their bath, or carrying on the love affairs
that the sudden spell of fine weather provoked. The London
sparrows, even the flies, detained him.</p>
<p>He caught himself wondering why he still lived in London.
He had already made a good deal of money, enough to retire on.
Why did he still waste what remained of his early manhood in
this hateful way?</p>
<p>Were there not other lands that he could visit, lands with
blue skies and sparkling seas? Countries free from the bugbear
of what men called &quot;progress,&quot; more primitive, perhaps, yet
at the same time more peaceful? Places where people still
sang at their work in the hot sunshine ‚Ä¶ ?</p>
<p>He thought of all he had read about the lotus-lands of the
East and of scattered isles in the Pacific, of coral reefs and
golden strands. It was difficult to believe all the stories he
had read about such places, though he remembered the strange
chill the reading had given him at the time. There ought to
be, there must be, he felt, countries just like that, countries
where things happened, countries where the inhabitants did
more than merely catch 'buses and run for electric trains. He
recalled the sunny, golden advertisements he had read, the
travel-folders.</p>
<p>And he tried in his mind to decide if there was any place
that absolutely fulfilled his requirements. He felt a little
doubtful. Nothing short of a real fairyland would do.</p>
<p>For a long time he stood thus, gazing into the shimmering
fountain, but he no longer saw the water where the dirty pigeons
bathed. He saw the long line of a coral reef with the great
combers breaking over it in silvery foam against a background
of waving coconut palms on some enchanted island of the
Southern Seas. Soft winds brushed his cheeks. He heard the
sea-birds cry.</p>
<p>Dimly he became aware that a small boy was standing
beside him, gazing up into his face with large dark eyes. It was
these enquiring eyes that first arrested his attention, for they
shared, it seemed, his own vision, and saw what he saw. They
were looking, surely, at something the others did not see.</p>
<p>Yet the boy, at the first glance, seemed commonplace
enough ‚Äî like hundreds of others one saw pouring out of school
in a back street. Poorly clad, with a thin, half-starved body,
there was nothing about him the least attractive. On the
second glance, however, Tornado saw that there was a difference.
His features were finer than those of the average slum child.
In spite of his poor clothes, he carried himself with a certain
air, a kind of unconscious grace that suggested some wild animal.</p>
<p>Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court found himself staring at him ‚Äî
as a dog or other wild creature stares ‚Äî full of interest, curiosity,
wonder, all of them spontaneous and unconscious.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy a ticket, sir,&quot; said the boy in a pleasant, piping
voice. &quot;They're only a shilling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But where can I go ‚Äî in these days ‚Äî for a shilling?&quot;
Tornado asked, smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;All the way,&quot; the boy answered gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>All the way</em>!&quot; echoed Tornado doubtfully, his heart
beating.</p>
<p>He saw that the boy actually held pieces of blue paper in
his hand that looked like tickets. The sight troubled him.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; he stammered, &quot;of course, I will.&quot; He tried
to look as if he were amused, while actually a lump rose somewhere
in his throat, as he handed the boy a shilling and took
the blue strip of paper in exchange. His hand was shaking.</p>
<p>The little fellow turned to go, then stopped suddenly and
came back.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful never to lose it, Tornado,&quot; he said shyly. &quot;Full
directions are written on the back.&quot; And he turned away a
second time.</p>
<p>&quot;But ‚Äî how do you know my name?&quot; enquired Tornado,
trembling now all over.</p>
<p>The strange boy smiled up into his face. It was an entrancing
smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we know our customers,&quot; he said softly. &quot;They are
so few.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't sell many then?&quot; began Tornado.</p>
<p>This time the boy was really gone. It almost seemed as
if he had vanished. He melted away so quickly into the passing
throng.</p>
<p>Tornado looked at the blue slip of paper in his hand. On
the back, sure enough, were some lines of writing. The thin,
spidery letters were queer looking, and, instead of ink, some
silvery liquid had been used. But the directions, once he
mastered the script, were plain:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Be at the Robin Hood Gate at Richmond Park before noon,&quot;
he read, &quot;and there you will see a girl knitting beneath an
oak tree with a cat beside her. Show her this paper and she
will put you on your way.&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="iii">
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>For some time Tornado turned the paper over and over in
his hand. Of course, it was all nonsense. It was some charity
stunt, some treasure hunt organised to get money for a hospital.
It was one of these modern tricks that extort money out of the
sentimental crowd ‚Ä¶ And yet the whole thing fell in
so well with his idle mood that it provided just the excuse he
needed ‚Äî not to go to his office.</p>
<p>&quot;I will go,&quot; he informed himself, rather like a truant boy,
&quot;for the park will be lovely, and there may be somebody there!&quot;</p>
<p>He started off.</p>
<p>Looking back afterwards, Tornado often thought that the
strangest thing about this strange business was that, the moment
he decided to go, no further thought of his neglected work, of
his office, or even of his old life, ever crossed his mind. It was
as if his normal life had ended suddenly. He seemed to have
begun a new existence, while yet this &quot;new existence&quot; seemed
always to have been <em>there</em>. It had always been within reach,
only he had never found the way. The old shackles and ties
were now cut through, at any rate, and a new and thrilling
sense of freedom swept over him.</p>
<p>He had found liberty at last! He felt like a gipsy who
leaves the old familiar camp behind him, knowing that the
entire world is his to roam as he will. His office, his rooms,
Miss Slumbubble, were wiped out as though they never had
existed.</p>
<p>How he reached Richmond Park he never quite knew. No
memory remains. Whether it was by 'bus or taxi, on foot,
or otherwise, he could not say. It seemed to him sufficient that
he found himself at the Robin Hood Gate in an incredibly short
time. He was simply ‚Äî there.</p>
<p>He looked about him eagerly, but at first could see no one
that answered in any way to the description on his ticket. The
sun blazed down from a cloudless sky; the trees and grasses
still held the freshness of early spring; the scent of the good
clean earth was in his nostrils. And he drew in deep breaths
of sheer delight at getting away so easily from the noise and
smell of the city. The day was radiant, sparkling. His blood
stirred within him.</p>
<p>A park keeper, he noticed, was chatting idly with a nurse
girl, and an occasional car swept along the roadway with a swirl
of dust, yet without a sound. They were like pictures only.
But nowhere could he discover a girl beneath an oak tree with
a cat beside her.</p>
<p>Putting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out the blue
ticket, intending to read it over once again, but, even as his
hand closed on it, he became aware that he was looking straight
at the object of his search.</p>
<p>There sat a girl beneath an oak tree, exactly as described,
and a black cat was licking its paws beside her. He gazed.
A moment before the spot was empty. Yet no surprise stirred
in him. This, somehow, was just what he expected.</p>
<p>He was excited, but not troubled. A flicker of nerves,
however, it seems, ran through him, for he dropped his ticket,
and as it fluttered down and he stooped hurriedly to recover
it, the girl and cat both vanished too. He could not be quite
sure, perhaps, being too intent on picking it up again. Yet
it was nowhere to be seen. Only a large green leaf lay at his
feet. He grabbed it instantly ‚Äî and, sure enough, he again held
the ticket in his hand.</p>
<p>After all, he must have been mistaken about the disappearance
of the girl and cat. There they both were in front of him,
as plain as life.</p>
<p>He advanced. The girl watched him coming. She smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you found your ticket,&quot; she said. &quot;I was
afraid you might have lost it altogether ‚Äî like the others.&quot;
Her voice was soft.</p>
<p>&quot;Do most people lose it?&quot; he found himself asking.</p>
<p>&quot;Most, yes,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>&quot;And can you really show me the way?&quot; he went on,
after a pause.</p>
<p>The girl seemed amused at the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I can,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>Something within him hesitated and was afraid. He was
afraid of the question he wanted to ask, afraid that the reply
would never satisfy him. He took a gulp of breath. Then he
asked his question.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it to ‚Äî Fairyland?&quot; came his whisper. Is that
what the ticket means ‚Äî all the way to Fairyland?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I live there,&quot; replied the girl simply, &quot;and my name is
Chance. My sister, Luck, lives with me,&quot; she added, pointing
to the cat.</p>
<p>&quot;But how can a cat be your sister?&quot; Tornado asked.</p>
<p>The girl, without answering, looked at the cat, and Tornado,
following her glance, met the full glare of the cat's eyes. He
felt a faint shiver run through him. No further answer seemed
necessary. The eyes that met his own were not the eyes of a
cat, nor of a human being. They were the eyes, he realised
of a spirit ‚Äî the eyes of something ‚Äî of someone ‚Äî who had seen
the birth and death of worlds, yet still lived on.</p>
<p>A feeling of chill swept over him. Questions that sprang
to his lips died in his throat and remained unuttered. His
breath failed him for some seconds. He stared from one to the
other uncertainly, and for several minutes no one spoke.</p>
<p>With an effort, Tornado looked towards the park gates.
To his surprise some subtle change was already at work. The
gates became dim, the nurse girl and the keeper appeared less
distinct. He gazed hard, trying to focus his sight, but a tenuous
veil seemed to have fallen between him and the familiar world
he knew of old. No effort he made could pierce it quite. This
queer soft gauze fell between his sight and what he had always
known as Reality.</p>
<p>He turned again to the girl. Change seemed to be at work
in her too. She looked less homely somehow. Her hair, which
he had before described to himself as a washed-out blond, had
deepened in colour; her rather faded blue eyes had lightened
up. It was as if some hidden lamp shone through. She began
to glow, to radiate light. Second by second her beauty increased.
A kind of radiance seemed to surround her like a cloud, and
this light glimmered everywhere through the air.</p>
<p>Tornado next became aware that in some strange way
he, too, was changing. Slight tremors ran through him from
his head to his feet. He felt that he was altering, adapting
himself in some way to a changed condition of existence.</p>
<p>Everything in him, he felt, was being speeded up in marvellous
fashion, quickened, heightened, swept into higher,
swifter gears. His thoughts now tore through him at intenser
speed. Rapidity was the keynote. Soon, at this pace, he would
pass beyond the need of ordinary thought at all, of thought as
men knew it. A new power was invading him. Already he
seemed beyond the need of speech with his companions. Words,
syllables, were unnecessary, for in some strange way they
answered his unuttered questions. The blood raced through
his veins with a power that seemed strong enough to rend his
body in pieces. The tear and rush were furious. Yet he remained
utterly indifferent. In this new state the loss of his ordinary
bodily sensations, perhaps even of his body too, appeared a
matter too trivial to notice. There were more interesting things
to think of than that.</p>
<p>All the familiar landmarks were already gone. The park
gates, the keeper and the keeper's lodge had long since vanished,
and only the tops of the biggest trees remained above a kind of
whitish mist. Even while he looked these, too, disappeared
with a kind of spiral swirl. The familiar world had faded.</p>
<p>He found himself upon a sandy path running through long
heather to a lonely sand beach.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly on the sparkling water, and far
away he could just make out the dim shape of an island. Gulls
wheeled about the shore, and a heron, on lazy wing, passed
circling over his head.</p>
<p>He looked round for his companions. The cat had gone,
and in its place stood a dark and lovely girl. Her sister, the
fair one, stood beside her, smiling gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;You may call us Chance and Luck,&quot; she said, &quot;for thus
are we known among men. But these are only names. Others
call us Fate and Destiny, though these, too, are wrong. In
reality there is only the Deed and the Payment.&quot; She paused
and gazed into his eyes. &quot;Perhaps, this is too hard for you,&quot;
she went on gently, &quot;but, if so, Merlin will explain, for he is the
wisest of those who dwell in Fairyland.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="iv">
<h2>IV.</h2>
<p>Tornado was in no mood to quibble about names, or as to
what Chance meant by her talk of Merlin. He felt a new life
pulsing through his veins, and his heart sang with happiness.
He noted, almost without astonishment, that he had shed his
old clothes somewhere on the journey, his usual City clothes.
Now he stood clad only in a leather jerkin with bare and sunburnt
legs, and instead of shoes he wore rough sandals of deer's hide.
A long hunting knife swung at his belt. Only one thing was
missing, a familiar thing that ought to have been there too.
What it was he could not say. He recognised its absence ‚Äî
no more than that.</p>
<p>He noted these changes without surprise, but at the
same time there came a fugitive flash of memory ‚Äî a memory
of a dream, perhaps, that had come to him only last night.
Dreams have this way of cropping up in stray fragments
sometimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss ‚Äî er ‚Äî Slum ‚Äî&quot; he could not get the whole name,
&quot;and that place of torture I was going to in my dreams ‚Äî a
bell ringing, ringing ‚Äî letter ‚Äî lots of letters ‚Äî Mr. T. Smith ‚Äî .&quot;
He passed his hand across his eyes in a vague effort to remember ‚Äî
&quot;dear, dear, what a horrid dream it was ‚Äî and there's something
I've forgotten ‚Äî I wonder if ‚Äî &quot;</p>
<p>His eyes caught the figures of the two girls running past
him, and all memory of his dream slipped from his consciousness
in the way dreams always slip away and are forgotten. His
years had fallen from him like the leaves of a tree, and the vigour
of youth was in his blood. Adventure was calling to him with
her deathless voice. Laughing, he ran down the path to join
his two companions on the edge of the water. He saw their
gleaming white legs as they stepped into a small sailing-boat
lying in the cover, its bow resting on the yellow sand, its stern
just afloat. As he reached them they paused and looked at
him. They leaped back to join him, sitting down on the sand
and motioning to him to do the same.</p>
<p>Tornado sat down beside them.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the boat that will take you to Fairyland,&quot; said
Chance, smiling at him mischievously. &quot;Have you the courage
to go in her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; he replied. &quot;What are the dangers?&quot;</p>
<p>The two sisters whispered together for a moment. It was
Luck who answered him:</p>
<p>&quot;There is the danger of never getting back,&quot; she said, &quot;of
never returning. It takes courage, too, to cross the Dragon
Field to get to your home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My home!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Looking at him encouragingly, they laughed, and their
laughter, he thought, was like the music of bells coming faintly,
sweetly across summer meadows.</p>
<p>&quot;Your home, yes,&quot; explained Chance. &quot;Hasn't your home
always been here? Haven't you yourself made it here? Through
all the dull years, haven't you dreamed of a little house on the
edge of the forest, near a pool where the deer come down to
drink at nightfall? And a glade where the stags roar when the
autumn leaves are falling? And a sailing boat that will take
you far away to some enchanted isle? And a girl, perhaps,
with dark hair or with blond, and smiling eyes and happy
laughter?&quot;</p>
<p>He knew it was all too true. For years and years, all
through his life, he had dreamed such things. From boyhood
he had dreamed of fords where knights-errant held the crossings
against all comers. Sometimes in his dreams he had seen a
battlemented town gay with flags, with strange old-world houses
and narrow, twisting streets. Time after time he had seen the
same town, so that in the end it had become as familiar to him
as his own small bit of London. He could find his way about it
quite well. He knew where the armourer had his shop and where
the leather-workers lived. Even the faces of the people who
kept the market stalls in the quaint little square by the church
were all familiar. Yet he was never quite sure of his own standing
in the town. Even in his dreams he was a little puzzled. Some
of the people saw and recognised him, but others completely
ignored him as though he was not there. All the same, he felt
that it was his own town in a sense. He knew it all, from the
archery butts to the tilting ground, where brave tournaments
were held with the splintering of lances.</p>
<p>He looked at his two companions. He saw that they read
his thoughts, and that there was no need of explanations.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me, please, about the Dragon Field,&quot; he said, a queer
trembling shyness in him. &quot;Are they dangerous?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are terrifying,&quot; said Luck. &quot;You see, they are the
Guardians, and they don't let everybody by. They will not
touch you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whom do they stop?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Luck reflected a moment. &quot;Oh, quite a lot of people,&quot;
she replied presently. &quot;Those who are cruel to animals and
children chiefly. Then money-grubbers and gluttons, the kind
that are always thinking of their comfort and their clothes and
their looks. Fat people, too, with shiny skins. You know the sort.&quot;</p>
<p>Tornado sighed. &quot;Of course,&quot; he agreed, &quot;it would never
do to let them in. They would make the place impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And people who never, never take any sort of risk?&quot; Luck
added.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Tornado to himself, and fell to thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that Fairyland that I see over there?&quot; he asked after
a while, pointing to a misty island far away. He had noticed
it when he first arrived at the beach. Very dim and distant
it seemed.</p>
<p>Luck's expression and voice were graver as she answered.
&quot;You would find it difficult to land there,&quot; she told him. &quot;That
is called Hi Bresil by some, by others the Isle of Avalon. The
souls of those who perish on some high adventure go there.
It is where King Arthur went to rest after his last battle and
before he came back to take possession of his two kingdoms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His two kingdoms?&quot; Tornado exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Luck, &quot;for does he not reign for ever in the
hearts of the young ‚Äî and in Fairyland?&quot;</p>
<p>She turned and looked at her sister, exchanging an understanding
smile, then turned back to Tornado.</p>
<p>&quot;And now we must leave you,&quot; she said. &quot;There is your
boat. Follow that gull with the black patch on his wing, and
he will guide you.&quot;</p>
<p>The two sisters drew aside and waited, and though Tornado
could have gone on talking with them for ever, he realised by
the tone of the girl's voice, as also by the smile he had seen on
both their faces, that it was time for him to go. He, at any
rate, was not one of those who never take a risk, he tried to
assure himself.</p>
<p>He got into the boat and stepped the mast. A light wind
had sprung up, blowing off the land. He said good-bye to the
two girls and pushed off boldly. He set the sail. Gaily the
little craft slid through the water towards its strange and distant
goal, as, looking back, he saw Luck and Chance still standing
on the yellow beach, side by side, watching him. He waved his
hand and they waved back. A moment later, when he turned
again, he saw them turn and walk away inland till they disappeared
among the trees.</p>
<p>The gull flew steadily ahead, occasionally soaring high up
into the blue, at other times diving down and lightly skimming
the tops of the waves. Sometimes it flew round and round the
boat for a few moments, passing close to Tornado's head and
peering into his face with its bright peeping eyes.</p>
<p>The wind increased the farther he left the shore, and
Tornado found that his little boat was really travelling quite
fast through the water. He soon lost sight of land, and only
the misty shores of Hi Bresil were visible far ahead. He must
have sailed like this for some hours before he discerned a dark
spot on the horizon. The wind was rising all this time, and his
boat seemed to travel ever faster and faster, leaping from wave
to wave like a thing possessed.</p>
<p>For the past hour or two he had been afraid of driving
her under and had cased her occasionally, but seeing how bravely
she sailed he now let her have her head, comforting himself
with the thought that she was a magic boat in any case and
ought to know how to keep afloat.</p>
<p>The land drew nearer. He was now rapidly getting near
enough to distinguish details. Tall hills, he saw, rose inland,
but close along the shore the ground seemed to be flat and
wooded. He could see no signs of houses or inhabitants. The
coast appeared utterly deserted. But it was also an iron-bound
coast. Great rocks jutted out into the sea and the waves broke
white over them. The flat portions of the shore, he now saw,
were few and far between.</p>
<p>It looked impossible for a small boat to make the land;
but Tornado, with blind faith in the gull, followed where it led ‚Äî
straight in towards the rocks. Once or twice, he noticed, the
bird turned its head quickly as though to reassure him. Nearer
and nearer they came, and though he felt a little sick with fear,
there was no turning back now. The roar of the surf thundered
all round him, the spray wet his face, and the boat felt the surge
of the great combers as they hurled themselves over the jagged
rocks. He held his breath.</p>
<p>At the last moment, when everything seemed lost, a narrow
channel opened suddenly before him, and the little boat swept
through between the dangerous rocky walls into a tiny cove.
Once inside, all was quiet. The wind, shut off by the high walls
all round, hardly rippled the surface of the blue water which
lapped peacefully along the narrow sandy bay. And, to his
surprise, he saw that there was actually a little pier made of
rough slabs of stone, with a ring of twisted withies to which he
could fasten his boat. A moment later he had tied her up and
leapt ashore.</p>
<p>The gull, as if satisfied that its job was done, flew several
times round his head, screaming shrilly as though to say goodbye,
and then headed straight out to sea. Tornado waved his
hand in farewell. He fancied he saw it flirt its wing with the
black spot by way of answer. He watched it disappear into the
blaze of sunshine above the wide blue sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="v">
<h2>V.</h2>
<p>Tornado stood still for some time, taking stock of his surroundings.
There seemed to be a footpath from the pier that
led directly into the forest. It lost itself at once among the
dense trees. After examining the ground in all directions this
path appeared the only way he could go, for the shore revealed
no openings, and behind him was, of course, the open sea, His
best, his only, plan was to follow where it led, since it must, at
any rate, lead somewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Now for the dragons!&quot; he thought uneasily, as a wave
of misgiving swept over him. Instinctively, as he started, he
loosened the long hunting knife at his belt, although he knew
quite well that it would be useless against a dragon that really
meant business. The undoubted fact that he was taking a
risk pleased him nevertheless; it proved him worthy of being
admitted to Hi Bresil.</p>
<p>As he went cautiously along, keeping his eyes on both sides
and in front as well, the trees grew thicker and thicker, larger
and larger, so that at last he appeared to be walking in a kind
of green tunnel, the branches meeting above his head. Here
and there a splash of sunlight stole through and turned some
strange flower by the path into a flaming jewel. His feet made
no sound on the mossy ground. Silent as the grave the forest
was, for no wind stirred.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, the path led into the open, the trees fell
away, and a large clearing lay before him. Deer were grazing
quietly all over it. Tornado stiffened like a dog scenting
game and almost unconsciously slipped behind a tree to
watch them. There were red deer and fallow, here and there
an occasional roe, while in the distance he saw other deer
that were quite strange to him. But, as his eyes swept the
herds, picking out the best beasts in each, his attention was
suddenly held by the sight of another animal altogether, and a
very weird one.</p>
<p>It was lying down when he first saw it, but, as he watched,
it rose slowly and stretched itself. Larger than a stag, he noticed,
and coloured like a rocking-horse, dappled black and white,
There was no mistaking what it was when he saw the long straight
horn coming out of the forehead. He caught his breath. It
was the unicorn. Its eyes gazed gently about it, as though,
without being alarmed, it somehow knew that a stranger was
in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&quot;What a gracious, splendid creature!&quot; he exclaimed to
himself as he gazed, and a thrill ran through him, for he knew
that the unicorn roams no other pastures save those of Fairyland,
and that he had, therefore, really arrived,</p>
<p>He must have stood behind his tree for a long time watching
the stately creature, his eyes wandering towards the deer as
well, for he had quite forgotten the matter of dragons being
possibly in the neighbourhood, when there came a sudden roaring
in the sky, and Tornado, quickly looking up, saw six dark shapes
rushing downwards at tremendous speed towards the forest;
indeed, towards the very clearing at whose edge he stood concealed.
What looked like jets of flame preceded them, issuing,
apparently, from their mouths. They made a curious loud
rattling sound, with other noises that were half hooting and
half growling.</p>
<p>&quot;Bless my soul!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The dragons!&quot;</p>
<p>The shock to his mind and nerves was very considerable,
yet his interest was so intense that his fear was not more than
he could manage. It was odd, however, that just at this very
moment when his entire attention should have been occupied
with this arresting sight, he found time to think of something
else, <em>viz.</em>, that he had forgotten something. This certainty
that some familiar object was missing came back again. His
hand flew to his knife, but the knife was in its place. There
was another thing he ought to have had with him, only for
the life of him he could not remember what it was. It was
something he always carried. He used it for protection overhead.
What it was, however, he could not imagine. He had
not got it ‚Äî that was all he knew.</p>
<p>This thought flashed through his mind, then vanished
utterly ‚Äî and he concentrated all his attention again on the
dragons. They were much lower now, just above the tree-tops,
in fact, and one by one he saw them plane down into the clearing
and settle among the feeding deer as quietly as though they
were so many crows. The deer, too, seemed undisturbed by
their arrival, moving calmly to one side to give them room to
land. The unicorn went on rubbing its horn against a tree.</p>
<p>Only they were most certainly not crows. The jets of flame
that had poured out of their nostrils while they were in full
flight had died down, but a red glow showed when they opened
their tremendous mouths, while thin wisps of smoke curled
round their jagged lips and floated upwards into the still air.
Their huge sides rose and fell as they breathed, accompanied
by an odd noise, half rattling, half clanking, that was almost
metallic, and came, it seemed, from their interior.</p>
<p>Tornado now felt really frightened. The appearance of
these monstrous brutes was chilling to the blood. Any one of
them could have swallowed him at a single gulp; their fiery
breath could burn him to an ash in a moment; a blow from a
single tail ‚Äî and he would be reduced to a pulp of broken bones
and flesh. They were covered, he saw, with bright green scales
which gave out a clashing sound as they moved, Their legs and
claws were a brilliant scarlet, while their eyes, as large as soup
plates, glowed with alternate red and green as though lit by
some internal fire.</p>
<p>On landing they had folded their wings, which towered
above their backs fully thirty feet into the air.</p>
<p>He stared and stared, and the more he stared the less he
liked them. He realised that their arrival coincided too accurately
with his own; they arrived because he had arrived. The
whole six of them, he noticed, had drawn themselves up directly
opposite to where he hid behind his tree, and the path he had
been following, the only path there was, ran right through the
middle of them. They had arranged themselves with military
precision, three on each side of the path.</p>
<p>Peering cautiously round the trunk that sheltered him,
he noticed these details, And his heart sank into his deerskin
sandals.</p>
<p>Yet his profound trust in what Luck and Chance had told
him did not waver. So far, he reflected, he had come safely
owing to their guidance. He realised he must trust them to
the end, or else fail to prove himself worthy of his quest. His
muscles, however, were like paper in his legs. He dared not,
could not, move ‚Äî when, suddenly, he heard a far, shrill cry,
and, looking up, he saw the gull with the spotted wing in the
air above the trees. It circled once, peeped down at him,
uttered its shrill cry a second time, and vanished into space.</p>
<p>It was this that decided him to act. Summoning up all his
courage, he took the risk. He stepped out from behind his
tree and walked slowly but steadily forwards in the direction
of the waiting dragons.</p>
<p>The nearer he drew to them the less he liked it. His blood
was water. He trembled. But he walked fairly straight,
giving no outward sign of flinching. Only a few yards now
separated him from the first couple in the dreadful row, and
he realised that there was only just room to pass between them
without actually touching. The slightest stumble, leaning an
inch to right or left, would mean that he would brush the awful
jaws. Indeed, as he moved slowly forward, the dragon on the
right yawned widely, showing an enormous mouth with huge
pointed teeth and a red tongue that flickered in and out with
a ghastly significance. It was licking its great lips, of course.
But the behaviour of its companion facing it on the left seemed
even more ominous, for its immense tail began to twitch and
swing from side to side like the tail of a cat before it springs.
It seemed to be gathering its vast legs under it as a kitten does
when it leaps playfully at a ball.</p>
<p>Tornado felt himself as the ball. His body dripped with
perspiration. His legs only just supported him. But he still
kept moving with slow steps forward, nearer and ever nearer.</p>
<p>At last he was actually between the first pair of mighty
heads. The creatures eyed him, but did not move. He passed
slowly onwards. He reached the second pair, whose eyes
similarly followed him, the bodies keeping motionless. A
whiff of burning brimstone came to his nostrils, blended,
he fancied, with another smell that was curiously familiar,
though he could not name it. He knew the name, but it
had vanished with another part of his life which, equally, was
forgotten.</p>
<p>The dragons, as he passed further between four more pairs
of heads, never moved, though following him steadily with
their fiery eyes.</p>
<p>When half way down the line Tornado only just controlled
a violent impulse to make a sudden run for it. It occurred to
him to dash wildly forward as fast as ever he could sprint ‚Äî and
trust to luck. But as the idea took form in his mind, the words
&quot;trust to Luck&quot; brought the quick knowledge that to carry
out his plan would betray cowardice and failure. To trust to
Luck and Chance was not to run away. There was Destiny.
And Destiny, though implacable, obeyed courage and determination.
He held on his dreadful way to the end.</p>
<p>And the end came, at last, without disaster. He passed
the final pair of monsters safely. Not one of the dragons had
moved. Now that he was beyond them, though only a few
feet, they still crouched unmoved upon the forest sward. Joy!
He had not failed himself! He had proved worthy of the
heritage of Hi Bresil, if only by the skin of his teeth!</p>
<p>Trying not to break into a run, Tornado, his breath irregular,
his heart thumping like a little drum, followed the path. The
unicorn came close, lowered its stately head, and nuzzled his
shoulder with its dangerous pointed horn. He looked a moment
into its gentle eyes. The herds of deer divided quietly to let
him pass, then fell to feeding again, quite undisturbed. In
fact, he had to wait once while a large company of them crossed
in front of him.</p>
<p>He had not looked back as yet, but now he heard suddenly
a tremendous rattling clatter, a hissing and a hooting, and,
turning his head, he saw the great dragons take the air. It
was a wondrous sight. They rose without effort, snorting fire
and smoke, their scales making a din of clanking metal, and,
once above the trees, he saw the whole six pass across the sky
in a wedge-shape formation like a skein of monstrous geese.
They became smaller and smaller as they rose into upper space,
their roaring died away, they were gone.</p>
<p>Neither the deer nor the unicorn, he noticed, paid the
slightest attention to this great commotion. Silence and peace
descended again upon the forest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vi">
<h2>VI.</h2>
<p>Tornado drew a deep breath and felt happier than ever in
his life before. Such happiness seemed incredible, yet he experienced
it. He was coming closer and closer to something he
had always yearned for. He longed to wait a while and make
closer friends with the attractive unicorn, but some instinct
warned him that he must not linger, but should push on farther,
for the climax of what he sought lay yet in front of him.</p>
<p>He had now reached the far side of the clearing. The sun
was sinking, the shadows growing longer. He began to think
vaguely about food, about where and how he was going to sleep
as well. He was not tired, but sleep when the sun went down
seemed natural. Should he lie down on the moss and ferns?
Should he look about for berries? The music of a tinkling
stream reminded him that he was thirsty. He knelt down and
drank his fill of sparkling water.</p>
<p>As he rose to his feet again the forest, it seemed, wore
another look. It was not <em>quite</em> the same as when he knelt down
a minute ago. He gazed about him. There was a certain
curious change, he fancied. He felt he had seen it before. The
fringe of the woods he was now approaching wore almost a
familiar guise. This old impression grew stronger as he walked
slowly on. The path, unless he was mistaken, would presently
take a sharp turn to the left just beyond that old gnarled oak
tree. There would be a cottage with a pool of water beside it.
He would go up and knock on the door, and the door would
open ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Sure enough, it proved exactly as he imagined. Leaving
the forest, the path turned sharply to the left. There stood the
cottage, the cottage of his desires, and the pool that he had
loved so long in dream. And that figure among the sunflowers,
was it Luck or Chance? He could not quite see. It disappeared
behind the rows of sunflowers where he saw the unicorn gazing
gently at him over the towering foxgloves. It was coming in
by the way back, of course, to open to him. His heart rose
triumphantly within him. He wanted to shout and sing. He
had at last come ‚Äî Home!</p>
<p>Tornado, his blood pulsing with this happiness, strode
boldly up to the door. He knocked confidently. He stood
waiting a moment. No one came at first. He knocked again,
but still no one came; there was no sound of a footfall. A
vague feeling of disquietude stole over him. Ah! there was
another way of getting in, he seemed to remember, and his hand
went automatically down the side of his leg as if hunting for
something he expected to find there.</p>
<p>Was it a pocket he sought? His pocket, at any rate, was
there as usual. The thing he looked for, too, lay hard and
firm inside it. He drew out his key and inserted it without
effort in the lock. The door opened easily as usual. He went
in, also as usual. There before him stood his girl-secretary, a
pile of letters behind her on the desk, again as usual.</p>
<p>A bell was ringing impatiently, ringing, ringing ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The girl's face wore a half reproachful look as she bade him
respectfully good morning.</p>
<p>&quot;A little late, am I ‚Ä¶ ?&quot; offered Mr. T. Smith, a
trifle apologetically. &quot;I ‚Äî er ‚Äî walked the whole way, I'm
afraid. The morning,&quot; he added, &quot;was so fine, you know ‚Ä¶ &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Smith,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;A pity it's clouded
over since.&quot; She turned away to answer the telephone, which
kept on ringing, ringing.</p>
<p>Even as she said the words he noticed that the first early
brilliance indeed had passed. The sky outside was dark and
lowering. Rain obviously threatened. The girl was gabbling
at the telephone. He waited, listening.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Slumbubble, sir,&quot; she reported, laying the receiver
down. &quot;To say you forgot your umbrella. She's sending it at
once by messenger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh ‚Äî ah ‚Äî yes,&quot; he murmured vaguely. &quot;I ‚Äî knew I had
forgotten ‚Äî something.&quot;</p>
<p>He glanced at his watch. After all, he was only fifteen
minutes late.</p>
<p>And perhaps another fifteen minutes had passed when a
small messenger boy arrived with his umbrella, offering a piece
of blue paper which Mr. T. Smith signed by way of receipt,
having first paid the little bright-eyed lad a shilling. He signed,
without thinking, &quot;Tornado Smith.&quot;</p>
