<p>Young Pelham
reached
the doctor's
house on the
stroke of half-past
eleven, and as he
pushed the Night Bell
button he felt pleased
with his punctuality.
He had kept the
appointment to the
minute. He looked
like a traveller just off the train, yet not
quite suitably dressed for a warm night
in summer. A hint of adventure might
have betrayed itself to a discerning eye.
In addition to a heavy overcoat, he
carried a plaid rug, and a walker's knapsack
was slung across one shoulder, while
a stout stick and a felt hat completed
the outfit. His mind ran over the contents
of the knapsack for the twentieth time ‚Äî
candles, thermos of coffee, sandwiches, book,
pistol; and the keys were in his pocket. He
had forgotten nothing. His bright eyes
betrayed a certain tension;
he was excited;
the occasional shiver
that ran down his
spine this warm June
night, he assured himself,
was anticipation
merely. Perhaps it
was. He remembered
telling his friend, Dr.
Feldman, that he
intended to go in any
case. &quot;I shall sit up till dawn,&quot; he said.
&quot;If you won't come, I shall go alone.&quot; He
had meant it, too, only that was in the daytime,
and now, with the darkness, his mood
had shifted. Companionship, he realized
would be most desirable. The presence of
burly Dr. Feldman, with his black beard,
his deep voice, his big shoulders, and his
clear brown eyes, would be undeniably
welcome.</p>
<p>He gave the bell another push, pressing it
hard, for the minutes had slipped by. &quot;I'm
on the tick,&quot; he repeated, looking at his
watch again. &quot;He said he would be ready
at eleven-thirty sharp, barring an urgent call.
Ah!&quot; he reflected, with sudden uneasiness,
&quot;I'd rather forgotten that!&quot;</p>
<p>A voice close behind him made him start,
and turning sharply he saw the door wide
open and the parlour-maid upon the step.
She had been speaking, he realized, for a
moment or two, but at first he hardly took
in what she was saying. Then his heart
sank. &quot;Gone out!&quot; he stammered, in
obvious dismay. &quot;But the doctor expected
me! We had an appointment!&quot; He was
rather flustered. &quot;It's just eleven-thirty, the
time he said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was an important call,
sir. Dr. Feldman left this for
you.&quot; He read the note hurriedly
on the mat. &quot;I'm
called out,&quot; it ran. &quot;Urgent
case. I <em>must</em> go. It shouldn't
take long, and I'll join you in
the house the moment I'm
free. Leave key under the
door. M. F., 11 p.m.&quot;
&quot;The doctor told me to
say, sir, that he should
meet you <em>there</em>,&quot; he heard
the girl's voice through
his shock of disappointment;
&quot;and
that he would
bring his own
things with
him for the
night.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man's composure was upset.
&quot;Yes, I see,&quot; he mumbled, stupidly; &quot;we
had arranged to walk instead of taking a
taxi, so as not to attract attention ‚Äî &quot;
He paused, realizing that the girl would not
know what he was talking about. &quot;Will
you come in, sir, and wait?&quot; she asked,
noticing his hesitation. No, he wouldn't do
that. He thanked her. &quot;It's all right,&quot; he
said, as casually as he could, then turned ‚Äî
it cost him a certain effort ‚Äî and walked
slowly down the deserted street alone.</p>
<p>This &quot;effort&quot; he noticed; the disinclination
to leave companionship and light.
The shock of disappointment rather surprised
him too: its strength, its almost bitter
flavour. Something that had lain unacknowledged
in him all the day, that had
become more insistent as the dusk drew on,
something he had deliberately concealed
from himself, was now suddenly so clear
that he <em>had</em> to face it. Pretence had become
childish merely. He did face it. The prospect
of sitting up all night alone in an empty
house he did not relish. &quot;It's absurd,&quot; he
admitted,&quot;but I am, I suppose, a bit
nervous!&quot;</p>
<p>He made his way slowly, very slowly,
across the dim Bloomsbury square in the
direction of the unoccupied mansion, turning
from time to time to see if anyone might be
following him. He would have given a
good deal to see the burly figure swinging
down the street, the black beard flying. But
pedestrians were few, and men with beards
were rarer still. The failure of his friend,
though understandable, had disconcerted
him more than he cared to admit. &quot;Barring
an urgent call,&quot; the doctor had said, and
the urgent call had come ‚Äî an unfortunate,
rather an odd, coincidence, the young man
felt. As a specialist the doctor's time was
fairly regular, night calls an exception. An
unwelcome flavour of question, though not
yet of doubt, crept in. His old friend, he
remembered, had not exactly favoured this
expedition. &quot;If you are sincere when you
say you want this experience for your new
book,&quot; he had said, reluctantly, &quot;all right,
then I'll come with you. If nothing happens,
at least I can study <em>you</em>!&quot; The mental
specialist was not interested in so-called
hauntings, but the reactions of a human mind
under the stress of unusual emotion might
interest him. He laughed and yielded.</p>
<p>Pelham drew nearer and nearer to the
great empty mansion he had visited already
in the daytime; its large echoing hall he
could easily visualize, the wide creaking
staircase, the carpetless corridors, the smaller
drawing-room on the first floor where he
proposed to keep his vigil. They lay in
darkness now  ‚Äî shadows, silence, emptiness,
devoid of normal occupants, at least. It
was a place that called for companionship
of a robust order. The house, with its grim,
dreadful story supported by incontrovertible
facts, stood waiting for him only a few hundred
yards down the deserted street. He
could already make out its square, uncompromising
shape, its unwashed windows
peering sideways at him. He found himself
walking slower and slower, dawdling, hesitating,
playing for time. An occasional pedestrian
passed him, and twice at least he recognized
his friend, only to discover his mistake
when they were almost abreast. A taxi
whizzed by noisily, a policeman laboriously
examined innocent doors, but the neighbourhood
lay otherwise still and heavy in
the thickish, humid June night. Gloomy it
was, the houses gaunt and gloomy too, and
the particular house that waited for him
came nearer till at last he stood opposite to
it. Instead of going in ‚Äî he passed it, with
a quick glance at the staring windows. He
took a turn round the square. &quot;I'll wait till
twelve,&quot; he told himself. &quot;When the clocks
strike midnight, I'll go in ‚Äî whether Feldman
has come or not.&quot;</p>
<p>Having made himself this promise, he
held to it. The policeman helped a little,
perhaps, for Pelham realized that he was a
suspicious figure, mooning about with rug
and knapsack in this desultory fashion, and
questions were the last thing he wanted.
The house soon faced him again, the policeman
a good way down the street: no one
was in sight, the clocks were striking the
hour. Walking boldly up the steps, he
inserted the key, entered the black hole that
gaped before him, and closed the door quietly
behind him.</p>
<p>Quietly, perhaps, yes, but a hundred
echoes went flying none the less, as though
the place were alive with footsteps, then
dying away into the deep silence they had
broken. The darkness was at first impenetrable.
A window was open somewhere, for
the last strokes of twelve came clearly down
the stairs. And immediately, before there
had been time to move towards a plan of
any sort, there happened two disagreeable
things, both of which he could explain, but
which he disliked because they revealed too
sharply his own condition. The second of
these two he explained, indeed ‚Äî with
difficulty.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The first, as he stood in the well of blackness,
not moving, breathing rather low,
thinking what he would do next, was a
sound close beside him; at his feet it seemed:
a curious shuffling sound, and accompanied
by a light, stroking touch upon his shoulder,
with the result that he had jumped a yard
and raised his arm to ward off a possible
blow before he realized that it was merely
the plaid rug which had slipped from his
shoulder and fallen with a faint swishing
noise upon the stone floor. He stooped and
picked it up, cursing his silly nerves. his
movement rapid, as though he felt safer in
an upright position, and it was a moment
later that the second disagreeable thing
occurred, the one he explained less easily.</p>
<p>It happened in this way. The instinct of
self-preservation was already automatically
at work, for while one hand picked up the
rug, the other, dropping the knapsack
clutched the flashlight in his coat pocket.
and had actually switched it on as he rose
into an upright position again. Holding it
askew, in that first second, the beam shot
along the hall floor, and the staircase went
directly in its full glare. The blaze.
however, was enough for him to catch sight
out of the corner of his eye, of  ‚Äî Dr. Feldman,
black beard and all, standing motionless
peering down upon him over the banisters.
Close to the top of the first flight he was, and
the very same instant, before the beam could
show him fully, he had passed silently and
rapidly round the angle and on to the landing
above. The following beam, now turned
full after him, showed no one. Stairs, landing
and banisters were undeniably empty.</p>
<p>Pelham did not move, he did not start,
much less did he jump; no single muscle.
in fact, stirred, The reaction was of another
kind: his heart missed a beat. Breath, at
the first gasp, was unmanageable, and at
the second ‚Äî well, some vivid instinct made
silence preferable to calling out. To shout,
&quot;Hullo, Max! Doctor, is that you?&quot; in
the great echoing hall was impossible.
Besides ‚Äî he already had found the line of
explanation ‚Äî the figure was not Dr. Feldman
at all. Instinctively, even before he began
to argue, he <em>knew</em> it was not his friend.
There could be no answer to his call. Dr.
Feldman was not in the building with him.
No one ‚Äî he almost said it audibly ‚Äî was in
the building with him. The figure was
imaginary, of course.</p>
<p>His critical mind, nerves or no nerves,
began instantly to argue towards firm
conviction. The sudden light, rushing
shadows distorted by startled nerves, the
fact that Feldman's personality lay vividly
in his thoughts, that he longed for him
eagerly, hoping with a kind of vehemence
that he would turn up any minute now ‚Äî this
was quite enough to manufacture the
desired figure out of a sudden glare and a
flock of leaping shadows. Holding the beam
more or less steadily upon the empty stairs
and corner of the landing, he explained away
the disagreeable thing. &quot;Why, even in the
street I mistook two fellows for him till I
got close enough to see my mistake!&quot;
Beards, he remembered, with a faint smile,
were uncommon these days, rare enough
to make an impression. The production of
a figure with bearded face was easy enough
with flying shadows. There had been no
sound of footsteps. And, as he argued, the
premonitory shiver down his spine, while it
did not wholly pass, grew a little less.</p>
<p>The mind, that is to say, provided a
passable explanation, although emotion,
being unable to argue, remained discontented
and uneasy. Emotion, he realized,
would be his problem. &quot;It's always primitive,
credulous, superstitious,&quot; he reminded
himself emphatically. &quot;To observe its
behaviour and to note the antics of imagination
is why I'm here to-night.&quot;, And wisely
then, before emotion might gain any further
advantage, he decided upon action. He
would search the house from top to bottom
before settling down to his long vigil. A
trick? A practical joke? His friend's
passionate interest in mental experiment?
The question of that &quot;urgent call&quot; again
flashed past and vanished.</p>
<p>Leaving his paraphernalia on the floor,
he took the pistol from the knapsack and
began at once his search of the empty
building, With firm, echoing steps, he
moved slowly up the staircase, flashing his
light in all directions as he went.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A large empty building is not inviting
in the darkness, nor is a flashlight,
with the contrast of inky blackness
just beyond its beam, the best way of
exploring it. The search undoubtedly
required nerve. This house, moreover, was
not merely empty; it was empty because no
one could live in it. So devoid was it,
indeed, of a pleasant living atmosphere
that two successive tenants, and that quite
recently, had chosen to die in it ‚Äî by their
own hands. And the reason for their choice,
according to Pelham's investigations, added
nothing to the homeliness of the atmosphere.
Two years before them, another tenant, the
origin of the present horror apparently, had
also done away with himself, after first
doing away, in ghastly fashion, with the
rest of his family. Crazed by drugs, drink,
love, or something equally powerful and
devastating  ‚Äî  Pelham had been unable
exactly to ascertain ‚Äî he had been found
among the grim remnants of his fearful
orgy, strangled by his own hands. His
imitators, it was held, owed their similar
fates to his vile, terrific, posthumous influence.
Subsequent occupiers objected
strenuously, broke their leases, paid money
rather than stay, even went to court. The
house, thus, was in the market for a song ‚Äî
and young Pelham was now searching its
dismal entrails at midnight with a shoddy
little flashlight. His object was to experience
at first hand, and for the purposes of a scene
in his new novel, what an imaginative man
would feel during an all-night vigil.c He
himself was an imaginative man, and he
got his &quot;copy.&quot; He got more besides.
The details remain the strangest among the
numerous remarkable cases in Dr. Feldman's
notebooks.</p>
<p>The search was thorough, but unproductive.
It established the fact that there was
no one in the great dismal building save
himself. It was hardly a reassuring process
for a nervous temperament, and it called
upon all his pluck to go through certain of
the rooms ‚Äî the servants' quarters, for instance,
on the top floor, the offices in the
basement, and certain large pieces that had
two doors. There was always the feeling
that someone trailed stealthily behind him,
that he was watched, that the piled shadows
concealed a figure. Once a door banged,
there were creakings everywhere, there were
groans and cracks and whispers down the
draughty passages. But the place, otherwise,
was still as death, holding its musty
smell, its gaping emptiness, its air of rather
sinister expectancy in common with most
other big unoccupied buildings. And, at the
end, Pelham stood in the hall again with the
satisfied feeling that he had done his job
faithfully, and that he could now settle
down in the small drawing-room for the
vigil proper. He had brought in a couple
of deck chairs during the day; he had his
book and candles, his coffee. Whether
Feldman came or did not come, he could
manage it. If anything happened, he now
told himself, he could manage that too.
He went upstairs and settled in. He was
calmer ‚Äî yes, even quite calm. He was master
of himself.</p>
<p>It was here that Pelham's version (marked
in red ink in Dr. Feldman's notebooks)
first caught the attention of the specialist.
The word &quot;calm&quot; was underlined, a mark
of interrogation in the margin. The search
of the building should have left the nerves
on edge; instead, the reverse had happened  ‚Äî
the young man had recovered his
normal quiet. He
felt &quot;calm,&quot; he
could &quot;manage
anything&quot; that
might happen
later. &quot;Didn't
particularly notice
this odd calmness
in himself,&quot; ran the
expert comment.
In talking it over
afterwards, Pelham
used another
adjective: &quot;sedative.&quot;
Uneasiness
had gone, he
declared, &quot;just as
though I'd taken
a sedative and it
was beginning to
work. I observed
everything
keenly,&quot; he tried
to explain, &quot;but
things that half
an hour before

me jump  ‚Äî  well,
they just didn't.

least of all. I was

Like being doped
almost.&quot; And in
the doctor's notebook,
on this point, is an interesting
and suggestive comment: &quot;This curious
preliminary calmness, though P. noticed
it suddenly, came on gradually no doubt.
He was aware of it only when achieved.
His own word 'sedative' indicates slow
approach. Morbid excitement had passed
completely, but acute observation nowhere
impaired. He felt 'prepared' for what
might follow. A <em>preparation</em>!?&quot;</p>
<!-- {{The deck-chair was occupied by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame, black beard and all.}} -->
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The young man, now settled comfortably
in his deck-chair, a rug over
his knees, the two candles on a packing-case
behind his head, sat reading his book
with one part of his mind, while, with
another part, he stared, listened, watched,
every muscle and nerve in alert tension, yet
wholly at his ease. His original jumpiness
had vanished, nervousness was gone, had
exhausted itself perhaps. Opposite to him
was the unoccupied chair intended for his
friend. Two blindless windows on his right
gave upon roofs and a night-sky too hazy
for stars to show. On his left, wide open,
was the door through which the top of the
staircase, with the few feet of banisters the
sham Dr. Feldman had peered over, was
just visible. The carpetless room had no
stick of furniture, the blank walls marked
only with lines of dirt where pictures and a
large mirror had been hung. A glass chandelier
above his chair sparkled faintly in
the flickering candle-light. The light, of
course, was poor.</p>
<p>Here he sat reading while the hours
passed and the night drew towards morning.
From time to time he pricked his ears;
creakings on the
stairs, cracks
of wood on the
floors above,
sounds in the big
hall below, those
he noticed without
a qualm, but
attributed quite
rightly to their
natural causes.
No purpose, no
intent, no meaning,
living or posthumous,
could be
ascribed to them.
Nothing approaching
a footstep,
much less a voice,
broke the deep
silence that
wrapped the
building from roof
to kitchen. Yet
his composure was
remarkable rather,
considering his
temperament and
his recent jumpiness.
And the
young man felt
disappointment
growing on him.
Even if he saw
and heard nothing,
he had hoped for
unusual reactions
of interesting kind.
These did not
come. After his
first bout of rather
boyish &quot;nerves,&quot;
his recording apparatus,
imaginative
or critical,
registered ‚Äî
nothing. His experiment
seemed
a failure; the
scene in his book
would gain no verisimilitude from the
description of an actual experience. He
even began to feel glad that Dr. Feldman
after all had not wasted a night's
sleep for nothing. Even if he saw a
figure now, his attitude would be one
merely of critical examination: could
he touch it as solid, walk through it,
could it answer questions or show intelligence
in response to his advances,
his calm, collected, cross-examining  advances?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. Feldman! He put his book
down, Ah! He had almost forgotten
him. The first keen longing, the bitter
disappointment, these, too, had left him.
He realized that, for a considerable time
now, he had not been alertly waiting for
his footstep, his voice, his brown eyes.
This expectancy had left him too. This
indifference, this forgetfulness, Dr. Feldman
also stressed in his own notebook ‚Äî as a
proof that Pelham's mind was no longer
working normally. &quot;Noticed his own
indifference,&quot; ran the comment in red ink,
&quot;but not particularly surprised at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Feldman!&quot; And Pelham abruptly
realized, for the first time, that he had
forgotten to leave the key outside the front
door. Completely overlooked it! Even if
Dr. Feldman had come, he could not have
got in. Perhaps he had already come ‚Äî and
gone. He would probably not have rung,
much less would he have knocked. Possibly,
indeed, reflected Pelham, the doctor might
welcome the excuse and go home to bed.
Well, it didn't matter, the young man
thought, as he went down cautiously in the
dark to remedy his oversight, but leaving
his electric torch on the packing-case. There
was nothing of interest here for his clever,
learned friend. He was relieved, in fact,
to have no critical observer of his own
disappointment, of this flat, uneventful, and
rather foolish night.</p>
<p>Key in hand, he opened the big door and
peered out into the deserted street. It was
between two and three in the morning; soon
the grey light would come in the sky. No
one was to be seen. He paused a moment,
standing on the step, then came back inside,
shutting the door carelessly, and with a
good deal of echoing noise, but again forgetting
to leave the key outside, an omission
only realized long afterwards. He started
to cross the hall. A faint light from his
open door above filtered down, so that the
banisters were just visible. And it was as
he crossed the hall that someone brushed by,
and passed in front of him up the staircase.
Though no actual touch was registered, he
was quite positive of this. Whether he
actually heard the steps he could not
swear, but that someone who had been
standing close beside him in this dark
hall now moved up the stairs ahead of him,
he was convinced beyond any possible
doubt. Had there been doubt, indeed, it
was at once negatived, for a second later he
saw the outline of a man slip along the
banisters overhead and move rapidly along
the landing. The outline disappeared towards
the door where the faint light issued. The
person, whoever it was, had gone into his
room.</p>
<p>Pelham went after this figure; he climbed
the stairs very quickly, almost ran along
the short stretch of landing, and, without a
sign of hesitation, entered the room himself.
&quot;I burst into it, in fact,&quot; he described it
afterwards. &quot;And there, in the chair
opposite to mine,&quot; he said, with intense
conviction, &quot;sat ‚Äî yourself. <em>You</em>, Max, sat
in that chair.&quot; The deck-chair was occupied
by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame.
black beard and all. The head was sunk a
little forwards, down upon the chest rather;
the eyes were closed; the breathing was
regular and sounded heavy. &quot;You looked
asleep, though naturally I knew this was
impossible.&quot; And in his written version,
Pelham, describing his own reaction to this
&quot;bit of nonsense,&quot; emphasized his impatient
resentment that a &quot;friend like you,
Max, should have played this trifling, rather
dangerous trick upon me.&quot; He felt sore,
even angry.</p>
<p>For in that first instant of inspection.
young Pelham realized that the doctor had
somehow secreted himself in the house from
the beginning, that the &quot;urgent call&quot; was
a thought-out detail, that it was, in fact, an
ill-judged practical joke. He remembered
his own first fugitive doubt. Dr. Feldman
was not going to lose a night's sleep for
nothing; he had always meant to make
use of the occasion to give his romantic
friend a shock, then study his nervous
reactions.</p>
<p>And Pelham resented the trick, its perilous
foolishness in view of his own nerves
and the fact that he had a pistol. So much
did he resent it that, taking his own chair
again, he sat there staring at his friend, a
kind of dull anger in him, giving no single
thought as to <em>how</em> the doctor had contrived
his trivial little plan. He did not speak, he
made no attempt to tackle him about it.
he did not even prod him out of this idiotic
pretence of being asleep. He just sat and
stared, this sullen, rather sulky anger in his
heart. He felt no relief that his friend had
come and now sat before him; he no longer
needed him, nor was his presence comforting.
Comfort, even companionship, of that sort
he did not want any more. Deep annoyance,
contempt to the point of bitterness almost,
was all he felt.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dr. Feldman, it seems, meanwhile
kept up this game of his with a steady
perfection that, the other felt, would
have been admirable in a better cause. He
maintained his pose of sleep without a flaw.
It was good acting. No sign of expression
showed itself in his face. The body was
limp with the relaxation of a man in deep
slumber. And the longer young Pelham
watched him, the more his angry vexation
grew. His thought found words such as
&quot;Idiot, imbecile,&quot; phrases like &quot;Amazing
trick for a man like you, a great mental
specialist, to play&quot; ‚Äî and finally, after
perhaps half an hour of this persistent folly
on the &quot;specialist's&quot; part of silence and
immobility, since it betrayed no sign of
explaining itself, Pelham took up his book
again and went on reading. He was furious,
yet wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>Comic, no doubt, the situation was, but
he was in no mood to appreciate its comedy.
He obstinately refused to speak, and in his
mind now was a sort of boyish determination
that he would meet the other at his own
game, and beat him at it too! He made
no sign, no sound. He merely read. The
minutes passed. Perhaps half an hour slipped
by, perhaps longer. His obstinacy remained
cast-iron. Dr. Feldman, for his part, also
kept up the nonsense; he aped slumber to
perfection; his breathing was heavy, heavy;
the black beard rising and falling with the
movement of his chest; the brown eyes
always tightly closed ‚Äî till at last, the
sound of a clock striking the hour came
faintly into the room where these two sat.
Pelham counted the strokes, and they were
three. There was a gleam of dawn. He
looked up suddenly from his book, hardly
knowing why ‚Äî</p>
<p>And this time he started. His blood
ebbed, then came back with a rush. What
was it? What did it mean? At the first
sight, in this faint early light, Dr. Feldman
looked precisely as before, ordinary, normal:
at the second, he looked ‚Äî  amazing. Every
atom of attention Pelham could muster
concentrated in his eyes. He stared till they
smarted, But his spine ran icy cold.</p>
<p>There <em>was</em> a difference, yet this difference
remained concealed. At the first glimpse it
was Max Feldman who faced him; at the
second, it was someone else. Thus he phrased
it in his written version, and the brevity was
significant. Here was something, apparently,
he could not describe. He shivered all over.
The former queer insensitiveness, the numbness,
had begun to pass. The &quot;sedative &quot;
effect was leaving him!</p>
<p>Thus, staring with all his energy, with all
available concentration, at his familiar
friend, he knew himself dreadfully overwrought.
Yet that &quot;second glimpse &quot;
refused to come back; the amazing
aspect of this well-known shape kept
hidden. He <em>had</em> seen it, however. It was, he
divined, still there. The blood gushed and
ebbed alternately; his feet, his back were
cold. He was &quot;all on edge,&quot; like a terrified
girl, The figure in the chair, so far as he
could analyse, had not altered; the burly
frame, the broad shoulders, the black
heard, the eyes closed in &quot;sleep&quot; remained
as before. &quot;The idiot,&quot; he tried to say,
&quot;still pretends,&quot; but his thought refused to
frame the words ‚Äî because they were somewhere,
somehow false. &quot;Idiot&quot; and
&quot;asleep,&quot; at any rate, were merely lies.</p>
<p>His written description of what followed
was extremely, curiously brief. His own
eyes remained glued, unable to move. He
stared and stared. The beard moved up
and down with the slow heaving of the great
chest, the relaxed body betrayed no tension,
the head sank forwards and downwards as
before. Then, suddenly, that &quot;second&quot;
glimpse, that &quot;other&quot; aspect came stealing
horribly back. The face, hitherto devoid
of expression, had begun to change. It was
slowly altering. Black and white entered
into it somehow, a white that was passionless,
a black that was diabolical. The
mouth, under the dark hair, sagged; the
eyebrows took a slanting twist, the jaw
beneath the beard thrust out. It became,
slowly but decisively, an entirely different
and an atrocious face. The mask slipped
gradually downwards from it. And young
Pelham, now bereft of power to move,
stared helplessly at the appalling change.
He was staring, he tried to tell himself, at
something he could not believe, something
that was not possible, something that
human experience cannot admit. But yet
he witnessed it. And he could not move his
eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's <em>not</em> Feldman, <em>not</em> Max Feldman, <em>not</em>
my friend,&quot; his thought struggled to cry
out, then realized vaguely that thought
was stifled in him, no longer operating.
Thought and volition had simultaneously
disappeared. And the head then suddenly
moved a little to one side. It slowly shifted.
The beard, at a new angle, now revealed the
neck. There was no collar.</p>
<p>He tried to scream, to shriek, but breath
failed him. Horror dropped over him like
ice. He trembled from head to foot. The
shuddering was audible, his teeth clattered,
his feet tapped the wooden floor. But he
still stared helplessly, because sight was
riveted beyond any power of his that could
either move his eyes or close them. He
became aware then that this demoniacal face
that aped his friend was about to change
still further. How he knew this lay beyond
him. He did know it. A faint quiver of the
cheeks betrayed it, possibly. Something
ghastly ran across the skin. He knew the
eyes were going to open.</p>
<p>There came a further movement of the
head. It lolled to one side ‚Äî frightfully. The
collarless neck was creased with dull red
lines. The same instant the two eyes opened,
giving back his own awful, fascinated stare.
They were bright, fixed, maniacal eyes.
Moreover, they were not brown, but black.
They gazed into his own with murder in
their depths. And the whole figure then
gave a convulsive shudder and began to
alter visibly like the face. With extreme
swiftness, as in a cinema, this alteration
supervened. The great frame seemed suddenly
to have grown emaciated, the big
shoulders sank and drooped, only the black
beard still flowed down the collarless neck
that was marked with its hideous red.</p>
<!-- {{Facing him on the step, an electric torch blazing in his hand, stood Dr. Feldman}} -->
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Then the outline rose. Leaving the
chair without visible effort, it stood
up, it wavered a moment, half staggering,
half lurching; the arms projected
abruptly; the hands opened long, muscular
fingers that moved through the air toward
his throat. He saw the eyes behind them ‚Äî
like shining lamps ‚Äî close.</p>
<p>The tremendous clamour that broke
here with its sudden clashing gave him, it
seems, the power to move his muscles. A
bell rang furiously, there was a violent
banging on a door. The building echoed.
The awful figure, though it did not seem to
pause in its advance, came, singularly, no
nearer actually to his face and throat. A
measure of volition, startled into activity
perhaps by the resounding noise, returned
to him. He sprang up, he shrieked as
though his heart had burst, he staggered
but he reached the door. He was down the
steps in what seemed literally a couple of
enormous leaps, and across the dark hall.
The same second he was fumbling at the big
front door, where the knocking sounded.
He opened it. Facing him on the step, an
electric torch blazing in his hand, stood ‚Äî
Dr. Feldman. He came in, closing the door
behind him with a bang. &quot;Frightfully sorry,
old man, but it took me longer than I
thought. You forgot the key ‚Äî&quot; was all
young Pelham heard before darkness fell
over him and he fainted in his friend's arms.</p>
<p>A swoon, rather than a faint, it was,
lasting perhaps a minute. A sip of brandy
from the doctor's flask brought the blood
back to normal ways. There followed
confused talk, questions, and somewhat incoherent
answers, and then ‚Äî Dr. Feldman
insisted firmly on this ‚Äî the visit to the room
upstairs. They went together, side by side,
arm in arm in fact, into an entirely empty
room. The candles stood guttering on the
packing-case, electric torch and pistol beside
them, a book on the floor, and a couple of
unoccupied deck-chairs opposite.</p>
<p>But young Pelham, shaking from head to
foot, white as chalk, found no very intelligent
words, and the specialist, thoroughly at home
among conditions of this kind, took him
home, administered a mild sedative, and
read at his leisure some days later the
account of Pelham's night. He had insisted
on a written version first. Talk followed, a
little study of his own as well, but this was
for his private notebooks, as were also two
facts he took some trouble to ascertain ‚Äî
namely, that the murderer used drugs on
his victims as on himself, and also, oddly
enough, that his maniac face held black eyes
and was adorned with a black beard into
the bargain.</p>
