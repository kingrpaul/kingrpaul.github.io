<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>It was the last night on board the
<em>Borotania</em>, as she was due in New
York next morning. Most of the
passengers were busy packing up in their
cabins, so that when I strolled into the
smoking-room I found it nearly empty,
with only a straggler or two lined up at
the bar. Fatty, however, was sitting in
his usual corner with his two inseparables,
Jimmy and Baldy, whose real
names I never discovered.</p>
<p>When I came in, Baldy was talking
about systems at roulette.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no systems worth a curse,&quot;
he was saying. &quot;It's all boloney to say
there are. And most of the wheels are
crooked, anyhow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you're right,&quot; Fatty agreed,
&quot;though I did once come across a system
that was infallible. The trouble was I
couldn't work it long enough to make a
real killing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how was that?&quot; Jimmy enquired.
&quot;Just that the inventor faded away before
we could clean up,&quot; explained Fatty.
&quot;Hard luck, you call it! Hard luck isn't
the right word. It was a catastrophe.
That's what it was, Baldy ‚Äî a catastrophe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, let's have the whole lie. Fatty,&quot;
said Jimmy and Baldy together, &quot;and we'll
tell you what we think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's gospel truth,&quot; came the rejoinder,
&quot;and no lie at all, though I can't blame
you if you don't believe it. It was about
the strangest thing I ever ran up against
‚Äî which is saying a lot. To this day I
don't know what to make of it. It
worked. I will say that for it. But it's
got me beat just the same.</p>
<p>&quot;It is some years ago now,&quot; Fatty resumed,
delighted to have even what he
considered a dud audience of two, &quot;that
I stayed on rather late at Monte. The
season was over, and the Sporting Club,
together with a whole lot of the better
hotels, closed down. I had my quarters
in a small pub on the Rue des Moulins,
I remember, as my own joint was closed,
too. The grub wasn't too good, and I
used to drop in now and again at
Quinto's to get myself a good lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;One day, after lunch, I turned into
the public gardens to smoke a cigar and
look at the flowers before creeping home
for a nap; and I remember that the cigar,
given to me up at the golf course by a
millionaire friend of mine, was particularly
good. I was enjoying it, smoking
away and feeling at peace with all the
world, when I noticed a curious-looking
figure moving along the path towards me.
He was an oldish fellow with a straggly
white beard, and he was wearing a funny
sort of hat on his head. I had never seen
a hat quite like it before, but I found
out afterwards that it was called a 'terai,'
or some sort of name like that, and that
it was worn a lot in India.</p>
<p>&quot;There were plenty of empty seats all
round me and I prayed to God the old
fellow wouldn't come and sit down within
talking distance of me and my cigar.
Yet that was exactly what he did. The
old bozo comes tottering along till he gets
to my bench, and then he parks himself
bang down quite close to me. Yes, he
parked himself just next door, so that I
expected the next minute he would turn
and ask me for a match.</p>
<p>&quot;But he had his match all right ‚Äî his
stinking cheroot, too ‚Äî and he lights up
and puffs away without a spot of trouble.
Now, as you boys know, if there is one
thing I cannot stand, it's the smoke from
one of those greenhouse bug-killers, so
as soon as he got going I was for going,
too. I sort of shifted my legs before
getting up, and it was just then he turns
and looks at me. Did I say 'looks at me'?
I can only tell you duds that there was
something in his eyes that made me think
of lightning. He spoke at the same time.
And his first remark somehow took my
breath away. I mean by that I hadn't expected
it.</p>
<p>&quot;'Could you tell something about the
gambling here?' he asks.</p>
<p>&quot;'Sure,' I says, getting my breath back
a bit, 'sure I can. What's troubling you,
stranger?'</p>
<p>&quot;His eyes flashed that queer way again.
but all he gives me back was innocent
enough. 'I understand they play a game
called roulette,' he says, 'but I don't know
anything about it. I'd like to.'</p>
<p>&quot;'The less you know, the cheaper for
you,' I tells him, knowing the answer pat.
For he didn't look to me like a man to
play the tables, what with his 'Oxford
voice' and his strange face that was half
a monk and half, I guess, a scholar. 'Keep
your money,' I adds, 'if you've got any.'</p>
<p>&quot;'But I want to make some money,' he
explains straight off the reel and quite
honest-sounding. I've got a plan that's
certain.'</p>
<p>&quot;And this time I looks him straight in
the eye, lightning or no lightning ‚Äî
though I admit there was something in
his eye that made me sort of wonder.</p>
<p>&quot;'Now, listen, pal,' I tells him, with a
fatherly touch that I knew didn't quite
come off. 'Listen to me, will you? Every
train that pulls into this burg has some
sucker on it that thinks he's going to
make good dough, but only one in ten
thousand ever gets away with it. You
take my advice and beat it back to Timbuctoo,
or wherever you hail from, and
just forget it.' And I takes a good puff
at my cigar for having given good advice
for once, feeling easy in my conscience,
if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>&quot;'I come from Tibet, not Timbuctoo,'
he corrects me slap, flashing those googly
eyes my way, 'and I've got with me a
magic mirror. I can't lose. It's a magic
mirror from Tibet, you see.' And his
stinking cheroot puffed across into my
face and made me cough.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&quot;Well, of course, I knew then that
the old boy was nuts. That Tibet-and-magic
business proved it. And yet
there was something about him that had
me guessing. I had the feeling that he
knew a thing or two I didn't know. I
can't express it quite. I knew I was on
the wrong tack, anyway. He had something
I'd never met before. I was underrating
him. He was child-like, crazy ‚Äî if
you like, but he was something else as
well. I only know I let my cigar ‚Äî that
millionaire cigar ‚Äî go out. That shows
you, maybe!</p>
<p>&quot;'What's the great idea?' I says, more
easily than I felt. 'Are you going to flashlight
from the mirror into the croupier's
eye and then grab some dough? If so, I
can tell you right now that those methods
won't work here. Maybe they're all right
back in the sticks in your Tibet, but they
won't cut any ice here in Monte!'</p>
<p>&quot;He gave me a sort of patient, half-contemptuous
look as though I was a
kid.</p>
<p>&quot;'The mirror,' he says quietly, 'shows
me what to play ‚Äî numbers and colors,
or whatever the foolishness is.' And he
pulls down that awful hat over his lightning
blinkers, puffs out a poisonous
cloud, and looks out over the flowers in
the garden. In other words, he showed
me plain enough that he thought I
wasn't yet born.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this had me fair flummoxed.
I just didn't know what to say next. I lit
up my cigar again, then threw it away as
it no longer tasted good. After a bit I
got going again. I asked him how he got
his mirror, thinking it a fair question.
And he gives me a long spiel about how
he had been interpreter with a British
expedition into Tibet, and how some
lama gave him the mirror. Good stuff,
too, right enough. He did the lama some
service or other.</p>
<p>&quot;'They call them devil-mirrors,' he
told me.</p>
<p>&quot;'For why?' I asks, wondering what
he'll throw me next.</p>
<p>&quot;'Because they bring death and riches,'
is the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Meself, I tells him I don't fancy mirrors
like that.</p>
<p>&quot;'You've never seen one,' he says,
knowing all the answers.</p>
<p>&quot;'True,' I tells him. 'Maybe I don't
want to.'</p>
<p>&quot;He said nothing for a bit then. I
had the feeling he thought I was a nitwit
from Kalamazoo. And that's just
what I felt, without knowing why ‚Äî as
though he was giving me the works and I
was just dumb.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he gets going again.</p>
<p>&quot;'I am an old man now,' he says. 'I'm
over a hundred, if you care to know, and
I wish to try this mirror before I die.
I promised the lama I would. I must.
Only, I need a helper. I cannot do it all
alone.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this flummoxed me right down
to the bone. Either he was nuts or I
was! Over a hundred, indeed! Why, those
eyes belonged to a young man! I thought
it over for a bit. 'Where was I?' I asked
myself. 'In Monte or in some weird
Tibetan monastery?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Of course,' I says at length, 'if that's
the way you look at it. I've got nothing
to say. Have you got the mirror with you?
I'd sure like to have a look at it.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Certainly,' he agrees, and pulls out
of his pocket a little chamois-leather bag
and produces from it a small bronze mirror.
I handled it cautiously, giving it the
once-over. It had some curious figures
twined round the polished surface ‚Äî
naked men and women, and their faces
were awful. I'm pretty hard-boiled myself,
but, believe me, those faces made
me shudder so I could hardly bear to
look at them. The old boy's mug, too,
had something in common with them, it
strikes me.</p>
<p>&quot;'Now,' he says, watching me hard,
'do you notice anything peculiar about
it?'</p>
<p>&quot;I looked carefully and turned the mirror
round in various directions so as to
get the reflection of the gardens and the
trees. 'No,' I tells him at last, 'I can't say
that I do.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Have you seen your own face in it?'
he asked at length, with a smile I didn't
care much about. His question gave me
quite a shock.</p>
<p>&quot;'No,' I tell him, 'I have not.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Just as well,' he says, 'for if you
did you would die.'</p>
<p>&quot;With that I hands him back his
mirror as quick as I could, but he only
laughs quietly to himself and slips it
back into its bag. And then I began
thinking things over to myself a bit.
After all, I thought, you don't get handed
devils' mirrors in Tibet for nothing. I
guess the old boy had to do his stuff
before the lama gave it to him ‚Äî something
pretty tough, too, or one of the
local gorillas could have handled it. And
so I came to the conclusion it was better
not to ask any more questions. The only
thing that really mattered was whether
the mirror would work or not.</p>
<p>&quot;'Go in and try it,' I says to him
straight. 'Why not?'</p>
<p>&quot;But he has the answer to that, too. 'I
must have someone with me,' he explains
again. 'When I see the numbers in the
glass I can't attend to putting the money
on as well. I need a helper, someone I
can trust. And I trust you.'</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&quot;I had got this far when a wave of suspicion
came over me. The old boy
was a 'con' man, and he was trying to
play me for a sucker. I expected every
moment his confederate would come rolling
up with some plausible yarn, and that
they would start stringing me along to
put up some dough. I kept my eyes wide
open, but I saw no one. And to fill in
time I asked him about Tibet. He told
me plenty about the country and certainly
seemed to know his stuff all right, but
as I couldn't check up on it, this didn't
get us very far. It sounded genuine, all
the same. He said he had been born at a
mission station right on the frontier and
that his nurse had been a Tibetan woman.
When his parents died he had got a job
with the Indian Government, and had
now retired with a pension and was on
his way to England. He told me a lot,
too, about having promised the lama
something about the mirror, but I just
couldn't make head or tail of that. He
wanted, anyway, to use it for getting
money, and here in Monte he saw a
chance. So I let it go at that.</p>
<p>&quot;'Sure you've never seen a roulette-wheel?'
I asks him.</p>
<p>&quot;'Never,' says he.</p>
<p>&quot;'Well, I'll take you right along and
show you one,' I says, and I bring the
old bird down the street till we get to a
shop that has them in the window. Half
the shops in Monte stock them, as you
know, so that we hadn't far to go. I
watches the old fox careful to see if he's
going to do an act, but he seems genuinely
interested, and he soon got wise to the
numbers and dozens and all that, and
how it worked. Then I asks him how the
mirror's going to show him what to back.</p>
<p>&quot;'I shall see the numbers or the color
in the glass,' says he.</p>
<p>&quot;'Well, if you've got any dough,' I
suggests, 'let's go to the rooms and give
the thing a whirl.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I have a thousand francs,' he says,
'if you think that will be enough.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Plenty,' I tell him, 'if the mirror's
any good. But let's start gently with a
hundred-franc stake, just to see how she
goes. If we win, we go on; if we lose,
we don't. How's that strike you?'</p>
<p>&quot;'We shall win,' he says, calm as you
like, 'and half the winnings will be yours.
You are entitled to them for your kindness
to a stranger.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this little spiel goes down very
well with me, so I just says 'Thank you,'
and takes his hand on it. Talk of a grip!
'That old hundred-per-center had a fist
like iron. Anyway, we wanders over to
the Casino and I gets him a ticket for the
<em>salle priv√©e</em> and in we goes. And, let me
tell you, the old bozo was on the up-and-up
all right, for when we gets to the
rooms he hands over his <em>mille</em> and asks
me to do the staking while he consults his
little mirror.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, as chance would have it, the
rooms weren't crowded, and we got a
coupla good seats right at the end of one
of the tables. I had changed the note into
<em>plaques</em>, and we were all set. The old
guy trots out his mirror and starts staring
into it. I watches him close. After a
minute or two his face kind of changes.
His skin went whiter and his features
became sort of fixed and hard. I thought
at first he'd dropped off to sleep maybe
with his eyes wide open, only I caught a
flash of what I call the lightning in them
and knew he was just too concentrated to
blink. You might have thought he was a
flapper going to put the lip-stick on with
that mirror in front of him. It was sure a
queer sight. I notice the croupier nearest
to us seems kind of inquisitive and keeps
looking at him, but he doesn't say anything.</p>
<p>&quot;They were paying out just when we
sat down, but now they spin the wheel
and it is time to stake. I glance at the old
crank and he mutters 'Fifteen,' hardly
moving his lips. It was fifteen the time
before, but all the same, my <em>plaque</em> goes
on, and sure enough, up she comes ‚Äî
fifteen! Now that, of course, might be
just luck, but it gave me confidence, all
right, so when next time the old bird
mumbles 'Twenty-one,' I shoves on two
<em>plaques</em> to see if I can't give the bank a
jolt.</p>
<p>&quot;And would you believe it, boys? Up
she comes as pretty as a picture, while I
rakes in the dough, trying not to grin
like a Cheshire cat as I does it. And so
it goes on, just as smooth and easy as I'm
telling you, and we sure gave the bank
a ride that afternoon. But I thinks it wise
to stop at last, as the old fellow is beginning
to look kind of petered out, it
strikes me; so I take him away to the bar
and give him a good slug of brandy, and
we split the dough as he said, and then I
take him back in a <em>fiacre</em> to his joint.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much did you win?&quot; asks
Baldy.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixty <em>mille</em> between us up to date,
and giving him back his <em>mille</em> as agreed.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&quot;Next morning,&quot; Fatty continued, &quot;I
went round bright and early to see
how he was making out, and I found him
in rather poor shape. So I tried to persuade
him to give the rooms a miss that
day. Nothing doing!</p>
<p>&quot;'Lead me to the tables,' he says, firm
as a rock. 'It was your brandy that upset
me a little, for, you see, I never touch
alcohol,' and by his voice you mighta
thought he was some professor at Oxford
starting up his lecture.</p>
<p>&quot;'Anyway,' I suggests, 'let's have a
good feed first,' and I makes in the direction
of Quinto's, for there was a bit of
time to fill before the rooms opened. But
will he eat? Not a damned swallow, I
tell you! Not a single bite!</p>
<p>&quot;'I shall see better,' he whispers to
me, 'if I have no food. But please do
not let me stop you. I will wait till you
have had a meal.'</p>
<p>&quot;So that's what happened. 'A crank,'
I says to myself, 'must turn his own
handle the way he wants,' and I left him
to it while I enjoyed the best blowout
ever with plenty of good liquor to wash
it down, and the old boy doesn't hurry
me one little bit, sitting there quiet and
silent as an Indian idol. And when I'd
lit my cigar we roll away in a <em>fiacre</em> back
to the Casino.</p>
<p>&quot;We go to the same table again, and I
notice the croupier recognizes the old guy
and exchanges a quick look with another
croupier, and the pair of them watch that
mirror pretty close, though there's
nothing they can say or do about it, for
any guy can look in his pocket mirror if
he wants to and see if his hair's straight.
And, believe me, that mirror does its stuff
again fit to beat the band. Or, I should
say, beat the bank. For it just couldn't
miss. Every time my pal mutters his number,
up it comes, though sometimes I
don't quite catch what he mumbles and
so hold back and don't put a plaque on.
And when that happens he gives me one
of those sort of lightning looks that puts
the blame on <em>me</em> all right. After that I
watches his lips. I make no further mistakes,
but start playing the dough real
heavy till we'd won so much I swear I
couldn't count it, and I could see that the
croupiers don't like it one little bit, they
don't.</p>
<p>&quot;And so it goes on and on, boys, with
me watching those mumbling lips like a
cat watches a mouse, and making no
more miss-hits, till sudden I notice that
those lips of his seem kind of white. No
blood in them, I mean. I give his face the
once-over, and that don't look right to
me, either. Made me think of a bladder
with the air running out of it. Something
was wrong, it seems to me, and I
decided we'd had enough for one day and
I'd better get him out.</p>
<p>&quot;'Come on,' I whispers to him. 'Let's
go. Give it a rest till tomorrow, pal.'</p>
<p>&quot;'One more turn,' he whispers back,
but the flash from those gig-lamps not
quite so bright. I'm seeing better than
ever before.'</p>
<p>&quot;So I agrees to that. One turn more
can't do us any harm, and he sure was
seeing perfect.</p>
<p>&quot;'Thirteen,' he mutters. And on go
my <em>plaques</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it so happens that he can reach
the number easier than me, so I hand him
the dough while I shove a maximum myself
on <em>impair</em>, just to give the bank a
final trimming before we blow.</p>
<p>&quot;The wheel is spinning lovely when I
hear a kind of gasp and a sigh from the
old boy, but when I turns quick to look
at him he seems okay. A moment later
the ball settles nice and comfortable in
thirteen, and they pay me on <em>impair</em> right
enough. Then a strange thing happens.
The croupier is in the act of shoving the
money over to pay the old guy on his
number when he stops, then pulls it back
again as though the bank had won. I
catches my breath and stares a moment.
And everybody stares with me. The room
had filled to the brim and everybody had
been watching our play. There came sudden
an awful silence.</p>
<p>&quot;I got my breath back.</p>
<p>&quot;'What's the matter?' I cries out. 'Pay
the old man his winnings!'</p>
<p>&quot;And the croupier turned to me without
a smile.</p>
<p><em>'On ne paye pas les morts,'</em> he said
quietly, raking the money in.</p>
<p>&quot;The old boy was dead ‚Äî dead as a
door-nail. He had croaked while the
wheel was spinning. Can you beat it for
bad luck? I looks round quick to see that
no one had pinched the mirror, but I'm
damned if it isn't broken into a thousand
pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't life just plain hell?&quot;</p>
