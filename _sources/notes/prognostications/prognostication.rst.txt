FLASH-RT was intended as a way to freeze patient motion, like a flash-cube in photography. 

But, the real excitement came from serendipity, with the discovery that healthy tissues are not as bothered by radiation, when it is delivered very quickly. 

A FLASH-RT treatment would be very fast, requiring a radiation beam about 100 times more powerful than is available today. 

But we Americans are very good at making our machines more powerful and when biology identifies a need, technology has a tendency to deliver. 

Because of its radio-biological advantage, when FLASH-RT becomes viable in the clinic, it will quickly become the standard of care. 

Every facility in the country will be shopping for a new particle accelerator. Whoever brings this to market first will be selling them faster than they can make them. 

And, then Varian will introduce a knock-off.

It should be possible to electronically switch quickly among a set of lunch-box-sized accelerators mounted on a fixed-ring. 

Electronic switching is much quicker than spinning an accelerator the size of an oil barrel around on a rotating gantry.

Fast electronic switching is central to the van-mobile FLASH-RT concept and demonstrated by SLAC (www6.slac.stanford.edu) who hopes to achieve the necessary intensity.

The concept is called a "PHASER" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor) as the linacs would operate out of phase with each other.

More recently, SLAC has announced the creation of a tiny linac "chip" powered by red light instead of microwaves. (https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/07/18/23138597881_adcdffc249_h-242f63c6993236cf7f7a8aa877cd7ac56f1f1751-s800-c85.jpg)

Switching a linac the size of a toothpick-sized should be much should be much faster even than one the size of a than a lunch-box.

In the way that a solid-state transistor is more efficient and less expensive than a vacuum tube; a solid state accelerator, driven by a laser-diode, might produce much less heat. 

SLAC's toothpick accelerator can produce 1-keV, but they intend to achieve 1-MeV -- which approaches Cobalt -- by the end of 2020 (stanford.io/35XudWC).

Perhaps the toothpick linac will become the basis for the clinical FLASH-RT technology that it seems clear is coming, whatever its form, in the near future future.

I am not sure what has been the impact of clinical ultrasound becoming a cell-phone app available from Amazon (amzn.to/360KGJA). 

But, when x-ray tubes shrunk from pounds to grams (bit.ly/362hUIm pg-16), they replaced radioisotope brachytherapy, which was probably a good thing. 

Will there be an intracavitary linac? Maybe. 

But it seems unavoidable that, on the path from 1 keV to 1 MeV, will lie a device that makes 100 keV. 

If it becomes possible to build a solid-state accelerator, operating in the diagnostic energy range, with a small focal spot and no hot-cathode; then the diagnostic x-ray tube becomes obsolete.

The Tomotherapy concept was borrowed from diagnostic imaging: a megavoltage CT in which the dose is the goal and the image a side-effect, inspired by a kilovoltage CT in which the image is the goal and the dose a side-effect. 

Perhaps the inspiration could go the other way by extending Stanford’s non-rotating treatment concept to CT imaging.

Electronically switching among micro-sources, fixed around a gantry, interspersed among detectors arranged over the full 360 degrees, could add a whole new dimension to available image data and produce a better image for less dose.

The future could bring interesting times – but, in a good way - for both imaging and treatment.
