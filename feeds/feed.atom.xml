&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On looking back, it seemed
incredible to young Monson that this
could have come out of such commonplace
conditions. For it started
while he was reading poetic stuff
about the Paestum Temples, and then
about the temples of Baalbec and the
worship of Jupiter Ammon, and his
thoughts had run off waywardly towards
Christ and Buddha, and he had
been wondering vaguely — Man in
the Street that he was — how such
vital and terrific forms of belief and
worship could ever die — when, abruptly,
someone came into his study with
a tiresome interruption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This note come by and, please,
sir, and would you please answer
immedshately, thank you, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monson acted immedshately and
read the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; forgive me, dear. I'm a man
short. 1:15 for 1:30. If you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; … do.
Felicity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, he believed he loved Felicity.
He could. He did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Telephone immedshately to her
ladyship to say Mr. Monson will be
delighted to lunch today at 1:15,&amp;quot; he
gave his answer. And in due course
he went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it lies quite beyond him
to explain why all the way to Curzon
Street, walking leisurely this fine May
morning, he was still aflame with
Baalbec, the Pyramids, the Paestum
Temples, and all that sort of delicious
ancient, romantic pagan stuff. Imagination
ran that way. He left it at that.
Some old-world glamour caught him
away into some strange, wild heaven.
He found himself suddenly loathing
the modern drabness, the senseless
speed, the artificial mechanism, the
clever, infinite invention that was
smart and up-to-date, and all the rest
of the rushing, uncomfortable nonsense.
Machinery did everything, the
individual nothing. A deep yearning
possessed him for the slow, worthwhile,
steady liveableness of other
days, when a man could believe in a
mountain nymph on many-fountained
Ida and worship her, by God, with a
conviction of positive reaction. He
heard the old, old winds among the
olives and saw the spindrift blow
across great Triton's horn, his sandals
trod upon acanthus leaves, the wild
thyme stung his nostrils. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In which ridiculous, even hysterical
mood, he rang the bell in Curzon
Street at 1:15 and waited upon admittance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ordinary was the next step, and
the routine of the steps following,
that he found nothing to remark upon
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; sweet of you to come and save
me. Lord Falsestep had a sudden Cabinet
Meeting. … I think you know
everybody. …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He caught instantly the usual deadly
savour. The cocktails and the preliminary
chatter shared this deadliness,
so that he found himself harking
back to Baalbec and Paestum and his
earlier foolishness, when, suddenly a
late guest was announced, but in such
a way that both his eye and ear were
caught, held, arrested — what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the
precise word? — startled is probably
the most accurate, but, at any rate,
taken with vivid painfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Painfulness?&amp;quot; Yes, assuredly, because
it hurt. A sharp, terrible sting
ran through him from head to foot.
Something in him blenched, ran hot
and cold, with an effect of dislocation
somewhere, so that his heart seemed
to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Bright Young Thing, or its
equivalent, chanced to engage him at
the moment, though &amp;quot;engage&amp;quot; is
wrong because the trivial glitter held
no power of any sort, and glitter is at
best a surface quality. It was, at any
rate, while exchanging glittering vacancies
thus, that he heard the foot-man's
voice and turned to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look! Rather to stare. Was it
man or woman, this late guest? Such
outlines, he knew, were easily interchangeable
today. It might have been
one or the other. &amp;quot;Or both,&amp;quot; ran like
fiery lightning through him, so that
he turned faint with the sweetness of
some amazing apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter in his ear seemed suddenly
miles away, and not miles alone,
but ages. Its tinkle reached him, none
the less, distinctly enough: &amp;quot; … so
you simply &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; come. It will be too
adorable. Without &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; it would be
just ashes. Wear anything you like, of
course, and doors open till dawn … &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bright Young Thing's invitation,
yes, oozing past her violent lipstick
reached him distinctly enough,
though it now had a sharply hideous
sound — because at the same moment
he had caught the voice of the
late arrival: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you for asking
me,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; and the words, so softly spoken,
had a quality that made them sing
above the general roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why then, did a wave of life rush
drenching through him as he heard
them? Why did his bones seem to
melt and run to gold and silver?
Whence came that breath of flower-laden
wind across the drowned atmosphere
of smoke and female perfume?
That tang as of sea and desert
air that for a moment seemed too
sweet, too strong, to bear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; … you promise. I'll expect you,&amp;quot;
clanged the invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course, I shall be delighted,&amp;quot;
came his mechanical acceptance.
&amp;quot;And I'll be there before dawn.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They turned away mutually — he,
because he felt curiously shamed a
trifle — she, because a young man
with a lisping voice approached with
a wobbling glass. Shamed perhaps,
yet faint as well, faint towards the
Mayfair room and atmosphere, but at
the same time so alive and exhilarated
toward something else that he
was intoxicated. He caught at the
edge of a sofa to hold him down. He
had a fear that he must rise to touch a
star, a nebula, an outer galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was confusion inextricable.
then somehow they were all in the
ultra-luxurious dining-room, and Felicity,
his friend's wife whom he believed
he loved, was dropping a hurried
whisper in his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You are an angel, darling, to
come. A woman has failed me too —
that impossible Ursula again. Do you
mind terribly? No, Lovely, on your
left. Just an empty chair … !&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was that the space next
to him was unoccupied, an empty
chair, just beyond which, he realized
with a lift of his whole being, sat the
late arrival whose voice, with its singing
beauty, had swept Today into the
rubbish heap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, until this moment, young
Monson — young as well as simple he
assuredly was — had held full command
of himself, since he had eschewed
strong drink and was besides
frankly bored, even feeling sorry he
had come at all. And boredom engenders
pessimism, not optimism. At
the same time, contrariwise, it awakens
a sense of superiority, false of
course, yet compensating, because
the mind comforts itself thereby that
it is superior to the cause of its boredom.
And until that amazing voice
had echoed across the room packed
with notables and nobodies, young
Monson's mood was as stated, below
par — bored a little. The Bright Young
Thing had exasperated with her affectations.
His spirits, though for the
sake of politeness to Felicity, his lovely
hostess, he had forced them to
spurious activity, were distinctly low.
There was nothing, therefore, to account
for the stupendous, gripping
interest he now felt suddenly in that
empty space, the breadth of an unoccupied
chair, that gaped — otherwise
somewhat menacingly — between
him and his neighbour. The interest
and stimulus lay in this: that across
the narrow emptiness the stranger
sat. One other thing lay equally beyond
his explanation — that, instead
of the sense of false superiority referred
to, he was aware now of inferiority
in himself that wakened a humility
of heart so deep and genuine
that he found no honestly descriptive
words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How calm, gentle, silent, almost
meek, yet never uncomfortable nor
out of place, the stranger sat there,
and not in any smallest degree embarrassed.
Entirely self-possessed,
moreover. He might have been the
host, a careless, understanding host,
whose carelessness and understanding
derived from the certain knowledge
that all were glad to be there.
Yes, it was a &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;, Monson now knew, a
guest quite unimpressed by the fact
that this was the luncheon of a famous
social and political hostess, and that
&amp;quot;those present&amp;quot; would be blazoned
tomorrow with photographs in the
daily press. Meek, perhaps, yet how
strangely powerful, how radiant, and
— the words seem childish — how
beautiful, with a power and beauty
beyond crumbling Baalbec and the
wind-worn Pyramids. And upon some
scale of mightiness that dislocated
his mind perhaps a little, since a perfect
blizzard of unrelated pictures
suddenly swept and poured across
his thoughts like an immense panorama,
pictures all scaled to mightiness,
so that his being seemed
stretched to capacity to receive them,
packed thus into a single flashing second.
They roared up, passed, were
gone, all simultanously … great
Stonehenge with its ache of grandeur,
Paestum with its rapture, the ghastly
loneliness of the Easter Island images,
the unanswerable Sphinx and
Pyramids, and then, with a leap of
terror, to the crystal iciness of the
deserted moon, the awful depths of
the nine-mile ocean bed … roared
past and vanished again, as he stole a
glance, wondering how for Felicity's
sake, his anxious hostess whom he
loved, he might approach his neighbour
with a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the stranger's further side, he
saw, perched an empty-headed Duchess,
avoiding him deliberately. He
met Felicity's beseeching eye. He
made a plunge across that gaping
chair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We must bridge this empty
space,&amp;quot; he ventured smilingly, leaning
over a little. &amp;quot;Some lady evidently
has been detained. The stress of London
life just now is hard upon punctuality
… &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something of the sort he said.
The words rather tumbled from his
mouth. There was a scent of wild
thyme as he leaned over slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other smiled, lifting clear,
shining eyes, so that young Monson
admitted to something again akin to
shock, a singular deep thrill of wonder,
beauty, humility. Was it man or
woman after all? shot through his
mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not detained perhaps,&amp;quot; the answer
floated to him, &amp;quot;but unaware.
Not dead, that is, but sleeping.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, there was no shock of surprise
at the choice of curious words a
foreigner might have found, or one
unaccustomed to modern usage, and
Monson felt he had merely misunderstood
perhaps. The voice was soft as
music, very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Late, at any rate,&amp;quot; he murmured
in some confusion, his eyes upon his
place, as though in search of steadiness.
&amp;quot;Too late,&amp;quot; he added, his search
for the commonplace still operating,
&amp;quot;for this delicious lobster &lt;em&gt;mousse&lt;/em&gt; —
or whatever it may be.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sweet, gentle smile again,
that scent and purity of wild flowers,
as he crumbled his bread and gazed
across the narrow space towards his
young neighbour, who sat unaccountably
trembling before something he
had never known before. Trembling,
it seemed to himself, with happiness
and wonder, yet with a touch of awe
due to the new sense of power and
splendour that rose in his heart. In
his heart alone, yes, not in his mind.
He established &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, at any rate. His
mind, if watchful perhaps and steady
enough, seemed suddenly inoperative.
What happened, what was happening,
lay in the heart alone. Thus he
found no explanation, as equally no
doubt or question, about seeing those
slender fingers radiant, the bread-crumbs
shining upon the table beneath
the other's touch, nor why,
though raised repeatedly to his mouth,
they multiplied on the cloth even
while he took from them. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye of Felicity from the top of
the long table flared at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the stranger offered nothing,
Monson, making a desperate effort to
get at his mind, rather than allow his
heart full sway, tried again after a
moment's interval. To entertain one's
neighbour was the acknowledged
price of admission to any feast, to sit
silent, at any rate, was not permissible.
Again, the words fell tumbling
from his lips without reflection, or
rather from his heart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My plans for today were otherwise,&amp;quot;
he mumbled, almost stammeringly,
leaning over a little as before.
&amp;quot;I didn't really want to come, but I'm
&lt;em&gt;awfully&lt;/em&gt; g-glad I did. It's so difficult
to — to live one's own life and — and
keep in the swim nowadays.&amp;quot; He
paused, watching a smile that opened
in those glorious eyes, yet did not
travel downwards to the tender lips.
&amp;quot;I was summoned at the last moment
because some Cabinet Minister and a
lady failed,&amp;quot; he fumbled on, &amp;quot;but I
wouldn't have missed it for — for —
everything in the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stopped dead. The other's lips
were moving. There was a light about
the face and head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I myself was asked indirectly perhaps,
but in true sincerity. And none
call on me in vain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the actual words, spoken
so low as to be just audible, that
floated across the space of the empty
chair. It seemed only a glance from
Felicity's eye along the table length
that held young Monson to his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poor hostesses,&amp;quot; he thinks he
heard himself murmuring, attempting
a smile of charitable understanding.
For at the same instant, turning
abruptly, he met the other's eyes at
the full. One look he saw, a look of
fire and glory like dawn upon the
Caucasus … and then a sense of fading,
the passing away of an intolerable
radiance that for a moment had
forced his eyelids to drop. Yet in that
fraction of a second, before they lifted
again, the words came floating in a
still, small voice that made them absolutely
clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;From her heart, it came. 'Oh,
Christ,' she prayed, 'Do please, come.
I need you.'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a stir in the room, a
shuffling along the table, as Sir Thomas
and Lady Ursula Smith-Ponsonby
arrived with many apologies and slid
gracefully into the two empty chairs
on young Monson's left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Breddle, airman, home
on sick leave from India, does not
feel himself called upon to give an
opinion; he considers himself a recorder
only. The phrase &lt;em&gt;credo quia impossibile&lt;/em&gt;,
had never come his way; neither had
Blake's dictum that &amp;quot;everything possible to
be believed is an image of truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was under thirty, intelligent enough,
observant, a first-rate pilot, but with no
special gifts or knowledge. A matter of
fact kind of fellow, unequipped on the
imaginative side, he was on his way to convalesce
at his step-brother's remote place in
the Welsh mountains. The brother, a much
older man, was a retired surgeon, honored
for his outstanding work with a knighthood
and now absorbed in research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airman glanced again at the letter
of invitation;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; … a lonely, desolate place, I'm afraid,
with few neighbors, but good fishing which,
I know, you adore. Wild little valleys run
Straight up into the mountains almost from
the garden, you'll have to entertain yourself.
I've got lots of fishing rods for you.
Nora Ashwell, a cousin you've never met,
a nurse, also on sick leave of sorts but shortly
going back to her job, is dying for companionship
of her own age. She likes fishing
too. But my house isn't a hospital! And
there's Dr. Leidenheim, who was a student
with me at Heidelberg ages ago, a delightful
old friend. Had a Chair in Berlin, but
got out just in time. His field is Roman
Culture — lots of remains about here — but
that's not your cup of tea, I know. Legends
galore all over the place and superstitions
you could cut with a knife. Queer things
said to go on in a little glen called Goat
Valley. But that's not down your street
either. Anyhow, come along and make the
best of it; at least we have no bombing
here. …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Breddle knew what he was in for
more or less, but was so relieved to get out
of the London blitz with a chance of recovering
his normal strength, that it didn't
matter. Above all, he didn't want a flirtation,
nor to hear about Roman remains from
the Austrian refugee scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was certainly a desolate spot, but the
house and grounds were delightful, and
he lost no time in asking about the fishing.
There was a trout stream, it seemed, and a
bit of the Wye not too far away with some
good salmon pools. At the moment, as rain
had swollen the Wye, the trout stream was
the thing to go for; and before an early
bed that night he had made the acquaintance
of the two others, Nora and Emil Leidenheim.
He sized them up, as he called
it: the latter a charming, old-fashioned man
with considerable personality, cautious of
speech, and no doubt very learned; but
Nora, his cousin, by no means to his taste.
Easy to look at certainly, with a kind of
hard, wild beauty, pleasant enough too, if
rather silent, yet with something about her
he could not quite place beyond that it was
distasteful. She struck him as unkempt,
untidy, self-centered, careless as to what
impression she made on her company, her
mind and thoughts elsewhere all the time.
She had been out walking that afternoon,
yet came to their war-time supper still in
shorts. A negligible matter, doubtless,
though the three men had all done something
by way of tidying up a bit. Her eyes
and manner conveyed something he found
baffling, as though she was always on the
watch, listening, peering for something that
was not there. Impersonal, too, as the devil.
It seemed a foolish thing to say, but there
was a hint in her atmosphere that made
him uncomfortable, uneasy, almost gave him
a touch of the creeps. The two older men,
he fancied, left her rather alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outwardly, at any rate, all went normally
enough, and a fishing trip was arranged
for the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I hope you'll bring back something
for the table,&amp;quot; his brother commented,
when she had gone up to bed. &amp;quot;Nora has
never yet brought back a single fish. God
knows what she does with herself, but I
doubt if she goes to the stream at all.&amp;quot; At
which an enigmatic expression passed across
Dr. Leidenheim's face, though he did not
speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where is this stream?&amp;quot; his brother
asked. &amp;quot;Up that Goat Valley you said was
queer, or something? And what did you
mean by 'queer'?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, no, not Goat Valley,&amp;quot; came the
answer; &amp;quot;and as for 'queer,' I didn't mean
anything particular. Just that the superstitious
locals avoid it even in the daytime.
There's a bit of hysteria about, you know,&amp;quot;
he added, &amp;quot;these war days, especially in
god-forsaken places like this — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;God-forsaken is good,&amp;quot; Dr. Leidenheim
put in quietly, giving the airman an impression
somehow that he could have said
more but for his host's presence, while
Breddle thought he would like to tap the
old fellow's mind when he got the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was with that stressed epithet in
his ears that he went up to his comfortable
bedroom. But before he fell asleep
another impression registered as he lay on
that indeterminate frontier between sleeping
and waking. He carried it into sleep
with him, though no dream followed. And
it was this: there was something wrong in
this house, something that did not emerge
at first. It was concerned with the occupants,
but it was due neither to his brother,
nor to the Austrian archaeologist. It was
due to that strange, wild girl. Before sleep
took him, he defined it to himself: Nora
was under close observation the whole time
by both the older men. It was chiefly, however,
Dr. Leidenheim who watched her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning broke in such
brilliant sunshine that fishing was out of
the question; and when the airman got down
to a late breakfast he was distinctly relieved
to hear that Nora was already out of the
house. She, too, knew that clear skies were
no good for trout; she had left a verbal
excuse and gone off by herself for a long
walk. So Breddle announced that he would
do the same. His choice was Goat Valley,
he would take sandwiches and entertain
himself. He got rough directions from Dr.
Leidenheim, who mentioned that the ruins
of an ancient temple to the old god, Silvanus,
at the end of the valley might interest
him. &amp;quot;And you'll have the place to yourself,&amp;quot;
said his brother, laughingly, before
disappearing into his sanctum, &amp;quot;unless you
run across one of the young monsters, the
only living things apparently that ever go
there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Monsters! And what may you mean by
that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Dr. Leidenheim who explained
the odd phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;nothing at all. Your
brother's a surgeon, remember. He still
uses the words of his student days. He
wants to scare you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, finding him for once communicative,
pressed him, if with poor results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Merely,&amp;quot; he said in his excellent English,
&amp;quot;that there have been one or two unpleasant
births during these war years — in
my language, &lt;em&gt;Missgeburt&lt;/em&gt; we call them. Due
to the collective hysteria of these strange
natives probably.&amp;quot; He added under his
breath, as if to himself, something about
&lt;em&gt;Urmenschen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unheimlich&lt;/em&gt;, though
Breddle didn't know the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; he exclaimed, catching his meaning
&amp;quot;that sort of thing, eh? I thought they
were always put out of the way at birth or
kept in glass bottles — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In my country, that is so, yes. They do
not live.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airman laughed. &amp;quot;It would take
more than a &lt;em&gt;Missgeburt&lt;/em&gt; to scare me,&amp;quot; he
said, and dropped the unsavory subject before
the old archaeologist got into his stride
about the temple to Silvanus and Roman remains
in general. Later he regretted he had
not asked a few other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Anthony Breddle must be known
as what is called a brave man; he had
the brand of courage that goes with total
absence of imagination. He was a simple
mind of the primitive order. Pictures passed
through it which he grouped and regrouped,
he drew inferences from them, but
it is doubtful if he had ever really thought.
As he entered the little valley, his mind
worked as usual, automatically. Pictures of
his brother and the Austrian flitted across
it, both old men, idling through the evening
of their day after reasonable success,
the latter with a painful background of bitter
sufferings under the Nazis. The chat
about collective hysteria and the rest did
not hold his interest. And Nora flitted
through after them, a nurse maybe, but an
odd fish assuredly, not his cup of tea in
any case. Bit of a wild cat, he suspected,
for all her quiet exterior in the house. If
she lingered in his mind more vividly than
the other two it was because of that notion
of the night before — that she was under
observation. She was, obviously, up to
something; never bringing in a fish, for
instance, that strange look in her eyes, the
decided feeling of repulsion she stirred in
him. Then her picture faded too. His emotions
at the moment &amp;quot;were of enjoyment and
carefree happiness. The bright sunny
morning, the birds singing, the tiny stream
pretending it was a noisy torrent, the fact
that &amp;quot;Operations&amp;quot; lay behind him and
weeks of freedom lay ahead … which
reminded him that he was, after all, convalescing
from recent fevers, and that he
was walking a bit too fast for his strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dawdled more slowly up the little
glen as the mountain-ash trees and silver
birch thickened and the steep sides of the
valley narrowed, passed the tumbled stones
of the Silvanus temple without a glance of
interest, and went on whistling happily to
himself — then suddenly wondered how an
echo of his whistling could reach him
through the dense undergrowth. It was not
an echo, he realized with a start. It was a
different whistle. Someone else, not very
far away, someone following him possibly,
someone else, yes, was whistling. The realization
disturbed him. He wanted, above
all, to be alone. But, for all that, he listened
with a certain pleasure, as he lay in a patch
of sunshine, ate his lunch, and smoked, for
the tune, now growing fainter, had an enticing
lilt, a haunting cadence, though it
never once entered his mind that it was
possible a folk tune of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It died away; at any rate, he no longer
heard it; he stretched out in the patch of
warm sunshine, he dozed; probably, he
dropped off to sleep …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he is certain he must really have
slept, because when he opened his eyes he
felt there had been an interval. He lay now
in shadow, for the sun had moved. But
something else had moved too while he
was asleep. There was an alteration in his
immediate landscape, restricted though that
landscape was. The absurd notion then intruded
that someone had been near him
while he slept, watching him. It puzzled
him; an uneasy emotion disturbed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sat up with a start and looked about
him. No wind stirred, not a leaf moved;
nor was there any sound but the prattle of
the little stream some distance away. A
vague disquiet deepened in him. Then he
cupped his ears to listen, for at this precise
moment the whistling became audible again
with the same queer, haunting lilt in it.
And he stiffened. This stiffening, at any
rate he recognized; this sudden tautening
of the nerves he had experienced before
when flying. He knew precisely that it came
as a prelude to danger; it was the automatic
preparation made by body and mind to meet
danger; it was — fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why fear in this smiling, innocent
woodland? And that no hint of explanation
came, made it worse. A nameless fear could
not be met and dealt with; it could bring
in its wake a worse thing — terror. But an
unreasoning terror is an awful thing, and
well he knew this. He caught a shiver running
over him; and instinctively then he
thought he would &amp;quot;whistle to keep his courage
up,&amp;quot; only to find that he could not
manage it. He was unable to control his
lips. No sound issued, his lips were trembling,
the flow of breath blocked. A kind
of wheeze, however, did emerge, a faint
pretence of whistling, and he realized to
his horror that the other whistler answered
it. Terror then swept in; and, trying feebly
again, he managed a reply. Whereupon
that other whistling piper moved closer in,
and the distance between them was reduced.
Yet, oh, what a ravishing and lovely lilt it
was! Beyond all words he felt rapt and
caught away. His heart, incredibly, seemed
mastered. An unbelievable storm of energy
swept through him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was brave, this young airman, as
already mentioned, for he had faced
death many times, but this amazing combination
of terror and energy was something
new. The sense of panic lay outside
all previous experience. Genuine panic
terror is a rare thing; its assault now came
on him like a tornado. It seemed he must
lose his head and run amok. And the
whistler, the strange piper, came nearer, the
distance between them again reduced.
Energy and terror flooding his being simultaneously,
he found relief in movement. He
plunged recklessly through the dense undergrowth
in the direction of the sound,
conscious only of one overmastering impulse
— that he &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; meet this piper face to face,
while yet half unconsciously aware that at
the same time he was also taking every precaution
to move noiselessly, softly, quietly,
so as not to be heard. This strange contradiction
came back to memory long afterwards,
hinting possibly at some remnant of
resisting power that saved him from an
unutterable disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reward was the last thing in the
world he anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That he was in an abnormal condition
utterly beyond his comprehension there can
be no doubt; but that what he now witnessed
registered with complete and positive
clarity lay beyond all question. A figure
caught his eye through the screen of leaves,
a moving — more — a dancing figure, as he
stood stock still and stared at — Nora Ashwell.
She was perhaps a dozen yards away,
obviously unaware of his presence, her
clothes in such disorder that she seemed
half naked, hatless, with flowers in her
loosened hair, her face radiant, arms and
legs gesticulating in a wild dance, her body
flung from side to side, but gracefully, a
pipe of sorts in one hand that at moments
went to her lips to blow the now familiar
air. She was moving in the direction away
from where he stood concealed, but he saw
enough to realize that he was watching a
young girl in what is known as ecstasy, an
ecstasy of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood motionless, staring at the amazing
spectacle: a girl beside herself with
love; love, yes, assuredly, but not of the
kind his life had so far known about;
a lover certainly — the banal explanation of
her conduct flashed through his bewilderment
— but not a lover of ordinary sort.
And, as he stared, afraid to move a step,
he was aware that this flood of energy, this
lust for intense living that drove her, was
at work in him too. The frontiers of his
normal self, his ordinary world, were trembling;
any moment there might come collapse
and he, too, would run amok with
panic joy and terror. He watched as the
figure disappeared behind denser foliage,
faded then was gone, and that he stood
there alone dominated suddenly by one
overmastering purpose — that he must escape
from this awful, yet enticing valley, before
it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How he contrived it he hardly remembers;
it was in literal panic that he raced
and stumbled along, driven by a sense of
terror wholly new to all his experience.
There was no feeling of being followed,
nor of any definite threat of a personal
kind; he was conscious more of some power,
as of the animal kingdom, primitive, powerful,
menacing, that assaulted his status
as a human being … a panic, indeed, of
pagan origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached the house towards sunset.
There was an interval of struggle
to return to his normal self, during which,
he thanked heaven, he met no member of
the household. At supper, indeed, things
seemed as usual … he asked and answered
questions about his expedition without hesitation,
if aware all the time, perhaps, that
Dr. Leidenheim observed him somewhat
closely, as he observed Nora too. For Nora,
equally, seemed her usual, silent self, beyond
that her eyes, shining like stars, somehow
lent a touch of radiance to her being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spoke little; she never betrayed herself.
And it was only when, later, Breddle
found himself alone with Dr. Leidenheim
for a moment before bedtime, that the urgent
feeling that he &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; tell someone about
his experiences persuaded him to give a
stammering account. He could not talk to
his brother, but to a stranger it was just
possible. And it brought a measure of relief,
though Leidenheim was laconic and
even mysterious in his comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, yes … yes … interesting, of
course, and — er — most unusual. The combination
of that irresistible lust for life, yes,
and — and the unreasoning terror. It was
always considered extremely powerful and
— equally dangerous, of course. Your present
condition — convalescing, I mean — made
you specially accessible, no doubt. …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the airman could not follow this kind
of talk; after listening for a bit, he made
to go up to bed, too exhausted to think
about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about three o'clock in the morning
when things began to happen and the
first air raid of the war came to the hitherto
immune neighborhood. It was the night
the Germans attacked Liverpool. A pilot,
scared possibly by the barrage, or chased by
a Spitfire and anxious to get rid of his
bombs, dropped them before returning
home, some of them evidently in the direction
of Goat Valley. The three men, gathered
in the hall, counted the bursts and
estimated a stick had fallen up that way
somewhere; and it was while discussing
this, that the absence of Nora Ashwell was
first noticed. It was Dr. Leidenheim, after
a whispered exchange with his host, who
went quickly up to her bedroom, and getting
no answer to their summons, burst
open the locked door to find the room
empty. The bed had not been slept in; a
sofa had been dragged to the open window
where a rope of knotted sheets hung down
to the lawn below. The two brothers hurried
out of the house at once, joined after
a slight delay by Dr. Leidenheim who had
brought a couple of spades with him but
made no comment by way of explaining
why he did so. He handed one to the airman
without a word. Under the breaking
dawn of another brilliant day, the three men
followed the line of craters made by the
stick of bombs towards Goat Valley, as
they had surmised. Dr. Leidenheim led
them by the shortest way, having so often
visited the Silvanus temple ruins; and some
hundred yards further on the gray morning
light soon showed them what was left of
Nora Ashwell, blasted almost beyond recognition.
They found something else as
well, dead but hardly at all injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It should — it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be buried,&amp;quot; whispered
Dr. Leidenheim, and started to dig
a hole, signing to the airman to help him
with the second spade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Burnt first, I think,&amp;quot; said the surgeon.
And they all agreed. The airman, as he
collected wood and helped dig the hole,
felt slightly sick. The sun was up when
they reached the house, invaded the still
deserted kitchen and made coffee. There
was duties to be attended to presently, but
there was little talk, and the surgeon soon
retired to his study sofa for a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come to my room a moment, if you
will,&amp;quot; Dr. Leidenheim proposed to the
young airman. &amp;quot;There's something I'd like
to read to you; it would perhaps interest
you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up in the room he took a book from his
shelves. &amp;quot;The travels and observations of
an old Greek,&amp;quot; he explained, &amp;quot;notes of
things he witnessed in his wanderings.
Pausanias, you know. I'll translate an incident
he mentions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'It is said that one of these beings
was brought to Sylla as that General returned
from Thessaly. The monster had
been surprised asleep in a cave. But his
voice was inarticulate. When brought
into the presence of Sylla, the Roman
General, he was so disgusted that he ordered
it to be instantly removed. The
monster answered in every degree to the
description which poets and painters
have given of it.'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, yes,&amp;quot; said the airman. &amp;quot;And — er
— what was it supposed to be, this monster?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A Satyr, of course,&amp;quot; replied Dr. Leidenheim,
as he replaced the volume without
further comment except the muttered words,
&amp;quot;One of the retinue of Pan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the last night on board the
&lt;em&gt;Borotania&lt;/em&gt;, as she was due in New
York next morning. Most of the
passengers were busy packing up in their
cabins, so that when I strolled into the
smoking-room I found it nearly empty,
with only a straggler or two lined up at
the bar. Fatty, however, was sitting in
his usual corner with his two inseparables,
Jimmy and Baldy, whose real
names I never discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came in, Baldy was talking
about systems at roulette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are no systems worth a curse,&amp;quot;
he was saying. &amp;quot;It's all boloney to say
there are. And most of the wheels are
crooked, anyhow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I guess you're right,&amp;quot; Fatty agreed,
&amp;quot;though I did once come across a system
that was infallible. The trouble was I
couldn't work it long enough to make a
real killing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how was that?&amp;quot; Jimmy enquired.
&amp;quot;Just that the inventor faded away before
we could clean up,&amp;quot; explained Fatty.
&amp;quot;Hard luck, you call it! Hard luck isn't
the right word. It was a catastrophe.
That's what it was, Baldy — a catastrophe!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, let's have the whole lie. Fatty,&amp;quot;
said Jimmy and Baldy together, &amp;quot;and we'll
tell you what we think.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's gospel truth,&amp;quot; came the rejoinder,
&amp;quot;and no lie at all, though I can't blame
you if you don't believe it. It was about
the strangest thing I ever ran up against
— which is saying a lot. To this day I
don't know what to make of it. It
worked. I will say that for it. But it's
got me beat just the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is some years ago now,&amp;quot; Fatty resumed,
delighted to have even what he
considered a dud audience of two, &amp;quot;that
I stayed on rather late at Monte. The
season was over, and the Sporting Club,
together with a whole lot of the better
hotels, closed down. I had my quarters
in a small pub on the Rue des Moulins,
I remember, as my own joint was closed,
too. The grub wasn't too good, and I
used to drop in now and again at
Quinto's to get myself a good lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One day, after lunch, I turned into
the public gardens to smoke a cigar and
look at the flowers before creeping home
for a nap; and I remember that the cigar,
given to me up at the golf course by a
millionaire friend of mine, was particularly
good. I was enjoying it, smoking
away and feeling at peace with all the
world, when I noticed a curious-looking
figure moving along the path towards me.
He was an oldish fellow with a straggly
white beard, and he was wearing a funny
sort of hat on his head. I had never seen
a hat quite like it before, but I found
out afterwards that it was called a 'terai,'
or some sort of name like that, and that
it was worn a lot in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There were plenty of empty seats all
round me and I prayed to God the old
fellow wouldn't come and sit down within
talking distance of me and my cigar.
Yet that was exactly what he did. The
old bozo comes tottering along till he gets
to my bench, and then he parks himself
bang down quite close to me. Yes, he
parked himself just next door, so that I
expected the next minute he would turn
and ask me for a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But he had his match all right — his
stinking cheroot, too — and he lights up
and puffs away without a spot of trouble.
Now, as you boys know, if there is one
thing I cannot stand, it's the smoke from
one of those greenhouse bug-killers, so
as soon as he got going I was for going,
too. I sort of shifted my legs before
getting up, and it was just then he turns
and looks at me. Did I say 'looks at me'?
I can only tell you duds that there was
something in his eyes that made me think
of lightning. He spoke at the same time.
And his first remark somehow took my
breath away. I mean by that I hadn't expected
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Could you tell something about the
gambling here?' he asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Sure,' I says, getting my breath back
a bit, 'sure I can. What's troubling you,
stranger?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;His eyes flashed that queer way again.
but all he gives me back was innocent
enough. 'I understand they play a game
called roulette,' he says, 'but I don't know
anything about it. I'd like to.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'The less you know, the cheaper for
you,' I tells him, knowing the answer pat.
For he didn't look to me like a man to
play the tables, what with his 'Oxford
voice' and his strange face that was half
a monk and half, I guess, a scholar. 'Keep
your money,' I adds, 'if you've got any.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'But I want to make some money,' he
explains straight off the reel and quite
honest-sounding. I've got a plan that's
certain.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And this time I looks him straight in
the eye, lightning or no lightning —
though I admit there was something in
his eye that made me sort of wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Now, listen, pal,' I tells him, with a
fatherly touch that I knew didn't quite
come off. 'Listen to me, will you? Every
train that pulls into this burg has some
sucker on it that thinks he's going to
make good dough, but only one in ten
thousand ever gets away with it. You
take my advice and beat it back to Timbuctoo,
or wherever you hail from, and
just forget it.' And I takes a good puff
at my cigar for having given good advice
for once, feeling easy in my conscience,
if you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I come from Tibet, not Timbuctoo,'
he corrects me slap, flashing those googly
eyes my way, 'and I've got with me a
magic mirror. I can't lose. It's a magic
mirror from Tibet, you see.' And his
stinking cheroot puffed across into my
face and made me cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, of course, I knew then that
the old boy was nuts. That Tibet-and-magic
business proved it. And yet
there was something about him that had
me guessing. I had the feeling that he
knew a thing or two I didn't know. I
can't express it quite. I knew I was on
the wrong tack, anyway. He had something
I'd never met before. I was underrating
him. He was child-like, crazy — if
you like, but he was something else as
well. I only know I let my cigar — that
millionaire cigar — go out. That shows
you, maybe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'What's the great idea?' I says, more
easily than I felt. 'Are you going to flashlight
from the mirror into the croupier's
eye and then grab some dough? If so, I
can tell you right now that those methods
won't work here. Maybe they're all right
back in the sticks in your Tibet, but they
won't cut any ice here in Monte!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He gave me a sort of patient, half-contemptuous
look as though I was a
kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'The mirror,' he says quietly, 'shows
me what to play — numbers and colors,
or whatever the foolishness is.' And he
pulls down that awful hat over his lightning
blinkers, puffs out a poisonous
cloud, and looks out over the flowers in
the garden. In other words, he showed
me plain enough that he thought I
wasn't yet born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, this had me fair flummoxed.
I just didn't know what to say next. I lit
up my cigar again, then threw it away as
it no longer tasted good. After a bit I
got going again. I asked him how he got
his mirror, thinking it a fair question.
And he gives me a long spiel about how
he had been interpreter with a British
expedition into Tibet, and how some
lama gave him the mirror. Good stuff,
too, right enough. He did the lama some
service or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'They call them devil-mirrors,' he
told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'For why?' I asks, wondering what
he'll throw me next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Because they bring death and riches,'
is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meself, I tells him I don't fancy mirrors
like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'You've never seen one,' he says,
knowing all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'True,' I tells him. 'Maybe I don't
want to.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said nothing for a bit then. I
had the feeling he thought I was a nitwit
from Kalamazoo. And that's just
what I felt, without knowing why — as
though he was giving me the works and I
was just dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then he gets going again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I am an old man now,' he says. 'I'm
over a hundred, if you care to know, and
I wish to try this mirror before I die.
I promised the lama I would. I must.
Only, I need a helper. I cannot do it all
alone.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, this flummoxed me right down
to the bone. Either he was nuts or I
was! Over a hundred, indeed! Why, those
eyes belonged to a young man! I thought
it over for a bit. 'Where was I?' I asked
myself. 'In Monte or in some weird
Tibetan monastery?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Of course,' I says at length, 'if that's
the way you look at it. I've got nothing
to say. Have you got the mirror with you?
I'd sure like to have a look at it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Certainly,' he agrees, and pulls out
of his pocket a little chamois-leather bag
and produces from it a small bronze mirror.
I handled it cautiously, giving it the
once-over. It had some curious figures
twined round the polished surface —
naked men and women, and their faces
were awful. I'm pretty hard-boiled myself,
but, believe me, those faces made
me shudder so I could hardly bear to
look at them. The old boy's mug, too,
had something in common with them, it
strikes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Now,' he says, watching me hard,
'do you notice anything peculiar about
it?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I looked carefully and turned the mirror
round in various directions so as to
get the reflection of the gardens and the
trees. 'No,' I tells him at last, 'I can't say
that I do.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Have you seen your own face in it?'
he asked at length, with a smile I didn't
care much about. His question gave me
quite a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'No,' I tell him, 'I have not.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Just as well,' he says, 'for if you
did you would die.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With that I hands him back his
mirror as quick as I could, but he only
laughs quietly to himself and slips it
back into its bag. And then I began
thinking things over to myself a bit.
After all, I thought, you don't get handed
devils' mirrors in Tibet for nothing. I
guess the old boy had to do his stuff
before the lama gave it to him — something
pretty tough, too, or one of the
local gorillas could have handled it. And
so I came to the conclusion it was better
not to ask any more questions. The only
thing that really mattered was whether
the mirror would work or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Go in and try it,' I says to him
straight. 'Why not?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But he has the answer to that, too. 'I
must have someone with me,' he explains
again. 'When I see the numbers in the
glass I can't attend to putting the money
on as well. I need a helper, someone I
can trust. And I trust you.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I had got this far when a wave of suspicion
came over me. The old boy
was a 'con' man, and he was trying to
play me for a sucker. I expected every
moment his confederate would come rolling
up with some plausible yarn, and that
they would start stringing me along to
put up some dough. I kept my eyes wide
open, but I saw no one. And to fill in
time I asked him about Tibet. He told
me plenty about the country and certainly
seemed to know his stuff all right, but
as I couldn't check up on it, this didn't
get us very far. It sounded genuine, all
the same. He said he had been born at a
mission station right on the frontier and
that his nurse had been a Tibetan woman.
When his parents died he had got a job
with the Indian Government, and had
now retired with a pension and was on
his way to England. He told me a lot,
too, about having promised the lama
something about the mirror, but I just
couldn't make head or tail of that. He
wanted, anyway, to use it for getting
money, and here in Monte he saw a
chance. So I let it go at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Sure you've never seen a roulette-wheel?'
I asks him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Never,' says he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Well, I'll take you right along and
show you one,' I says, and I bring the
old bird down the street till we get to a
shop that has them in the window. Half
the shops in Monte stock them, as you
know, so that we hadn't far to go. I
watches the old fox careful to see if he's
going to do an act, but he seems genuinely
interested, and he soon got wise to the
numbers and dozens and all that, and
how it worked. Then I asks him how the
mirror's going to show him what to back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I shall see the numbers or the color
in the glass,' says he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Well, if you've got any dough,' I
suggests, 'let's go to the rooms and give
the thing a whirl.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I have a thousand francs,' he says,
'if you think that will be enough.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Plenty,' I tell him, 'if the mirror's
any good. But let's start gently with a
hundred-franc stake, just to see how she
goes. If we win, we go on; if we lose,
we don't. How's that strike you?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'We shall win,' he says, calm as you
like, 'and half the winnings will be yours.
You are entitled to them for your kindness
to a stranger.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, this little spiel goes down very
well with me, so I just says 'Thank you,'
and takes his hand on it. Talk of a grip!
'That old hundred-per-center had a fist
like iron. Anyway, we wanders over to
the Casino and I gets him a ticket for the
&lt;em&gt;salle privée&lt;/em&gt; and in we goes. And, let me
tell you, the old bozo was on the up-and-up
all right, for when we gets to the
rooms he hands over his &lt;em&gt;mille&lt;/em&gt; and asks
me to do the staking while he consults his
little mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, as chance would have it, the
rooms weren't crowded, and we got a
coupla good seats right at the end of one
of the tables. I had changed the note into
&lt;em&gt;plaques&lt;/em&gt;, and we were all set. The old
guy trots out his mirror and starts staring
into it. I watches him close. After a
minute or two his face kind of changes.
His skin went whiter and his features
became sort of fixed and hard. I thought
at first he'd dropped off to sleep maybe
with his eyes wide open, only I caught a
flash of what I call the lightning in them
and knew he was just too concentrated to
blink. You might have thought he was a
flapper going to put the lip-stick on with
that mirror in front of him. It was sure a
queer sight. I notice the croupier nearest
to us seems kind of inquisitive and keeps
looking at him, but he doesn't say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They were paying out just when we
sat down, but now they spin the wheel
and it is time to stake. I glance at the old
crank and he mutters 'Fifteen,' hardly
moving his lips. It was fifteen the time
before, but all the same, my &lt;em&gt;plaque&lt;/em&gt; goes
on, and sure enough, up she comes —
fifteen! Now that, of course, might be
just luck, but it gave me confidence, all
right, so when next time the old bird
mumbles 'Twenty-one,' I shoves on two
&lt;em&gt;plaques&lt;/em&gt; to see if I can't give the bank a
jolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And would you believe it, boys? Up
she comes as pretty as a picture, while I
rakes in the dough, trying not to grin
like a Cheshire cat as I does it. And so
it goes on, just as smooth and easy as I'm
telling you, and we sure gave the bank
a ride that afternoon. But I thinks it wise
to stop at last, as the old fellow is beginning
to look kind of petered out, it
strikes me; so I take him away to the bar
and give him a good slug of brandy, and
we split the dough as he said, and then I
take him back in a &lt;em&gt;fiacre&lt;/em&gt; to his joint.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How much did you win?&amp;quot; asks
Baldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sixty &lt;em&gt;mille&lt;/em&gt; between us up to date,
and giving him back his &lt;em&gt;mille&lt;/em&gt; as agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Next morning,&amp;quot; Fatty continued, &amp;quot;I
went round bright and early to see
how he was making out, and I found him
in rather poor shape. So I tried to persuade
him to give the rooms a miss that
day. Nothing doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Lead me to the tables,' he says, firm
as a rock. 'It was your brandy that upset
me a little, for, you see, I never touch
alcohol,' and by his voice you mighta
thought he was some professor at Oxford
starting up his lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Anyway,' I suggests, 'let's have a
good feed first,' and I makes in the direction
of Quinto's, for there was a bit of
time to fill before the rooms opened. But
will he eat? Not a damned swallow, I
tell you! Not a single bite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I shall see better,' he whispers to
me, 'if I have no food. But please do
not let me stop you. I will wait till you
have had a meal.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So that's what happened. 'A crank,'
I says to myself, 'must turn his own
handle the way he wants,' and I left him
to it while I enjoyed the best blowout
ever with plenty of good liquor to wash
it down, and the old boy doesn't hurry
me one little bit, sitting there quiet and
silent as an Indian idol. And when I'd
lit my cigar we roll away in a &lt;em&gt;fiacre&lt;/em&gt; back
to the Casino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We go to the same table again, and I
notice the croupier recognizes the old guy
and exchanges a quick look with another
croupier, and the pair of them watch that
mirror pretty close, though there's
nothing they can say or do about it, for
any guy can look in his pocket mirror if
he wants to and see if his hair's straight.
And, believe me, that mirror does its stuff
again fit to beat the band. Or, I should
say, beat the bank. For it just couldn't
miss. Every time my pal mutters his number,
up it comes, though sometimes I
don't quite catch what he mumbles and
so hold back and don't put a plaque on.
And when that happens he gives me one
of those sort of lightning looks that puts
the blame on &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; all right. After that I
watches his lips. I make no further mistakes,
but start playing the dough real
heavy till we'd won so much I swear I
couldn't count it, and I could see that the
croupiers don't like it one little bit, they
don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And so it goes on and on, boys, with
me watching those mumbling lips like a
cat watches a mouse, and making no
more miss-hits, till sudden I notice that
those lips of his seem kind of white. No
blood in them, I mean. I give his face the
once-over, and that don't look right to
me, either. Made me think of a bladder
with the air running out of it. Something
was wrong, it seems to me, and I
decided we'd had enough for one day and
I'd better get him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Come on,' I whispers to him. 'Let's
go. Give it a rest till tomorrow, pal.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'One more turn,' he whispers back,
but the flash from those gig-lamps not
quite so bright. I'm seeing better than
ever before.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I agrees to that. One turn more
can't do us any harm, and he sure was
seeing perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Thirteen,' he mutters. And on go
my &lt;em&gt;plaques&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now it so happens that he can reach
the number easier than me, so I hand him
the dough while I shove a maximum myself
on &lt;em&gt;impair&lt;/em&gt;, just to give the bank a
final trimming before we blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The wheel is spinning lovely when I
hear a kind of gasp and a sigh from the
old boy, but when I turns quick to look
at him he seems okay. A moment later
the ball settles nice and comfortable in
thirteen, and they pay me on &lt;em&gt;impair&lt;/em&gt; right
enough. Then a strange thing happens.
The croupier is in the act of shoving the
money over to pay the old guy on his
number when he stops, then pulls it back
again as though the bank had won. I
catches my breath and stares a moment.
And everybody stares with me. The room
had filled to the brim and everybody had
been watching our play. There came sudden
an awful silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I got my breath back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'What's the matter?' I cries out. 'Pay
the old man his winnings!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And the croupier turned to me without
a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'On ne paye pas les morts,'&lt;/em&gt; he said
quietly, raking the money in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The old boy was dead — dead as a
door-nail. He had croaked while the
wheel was spinning. Can you beat it for
bad luck? I looks round quick to see that
no one had pinched the mirror, but I'm
damned if it isn't broken into a thousand
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Isn't life just plain hell?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;by Algernon Blackwood (1934)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander's experience with the blackmailer was
unique—it happened once only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been happily married for some years,
with two children, and was doing well enough in
his insurance business. Life, indeed, was quite rosy,
when one day a stranger called at the office and
asked to see him alone. This stranger was an elderly
man of perhaps rather shabby appearance, but his
face and manner were quite engaging, and he had
a really pleasant smile. His voice was cultured. He
was obviously a gentleman, a university man
probably. At the same time, there was something
about him that hesitated; he seemed shy, a trifle
nervous even. In spite of the worn, cheap clothing,
however, he made the best impression, and Alexander
believed that a bit of good business was coming his
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went into the inner private room. The interview
began in the bluntest possible way. Something
very determined had come into the stranger's manner,
almost as though he had screwed himself to say what
he came to say and meant to see it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Lawson,&amp;quot; he announced, &amp;quot;and I
need money badly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke rapidly, yet with a curious reluctance,
as though he said something he had learned by
heart and rather hated saying. &amp;quot;Some letters of
yours,&amp;quot; he went on—&amp;quot;it doesn't matter how—
have come into my possession. If you will give me
£20, they're yours.&amp;quot; And he drew from his pocket
a small packet, fluttering them before the other's
eyes so that the handwriting was plainly visible.
The hand that held the letters shook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock to Alexander, instead of the pleasant
surprise he had rather expected, was overwhelming.
With one look he had recognized the paper and the
handwriting. He blenched. A cold sweat broke out
on him. He was not naturally a man of much nerve
and he realized that a bluff of any sort was useless.
He had written those letters. He was frightened to
the bone. All he could do in that first instant was
to stagger to a chair, for his legs were too weak
to support him. He just sat down. The other man
remained standing, keeping a certain distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;T-twenty pounds,&amp;quot; stammered Alexander, half to
himself, trying vainly to collect his thoughts. He
was shivering visibly. Hot and cold he was. He knew
he was quite helpless. This was blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I'll hand them over,&amp;quot; Lawson was saying.
Then he added, as though relieved to say it: &amp;quot;And
you'll never set eyes on me again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But—I—I haven't got it,&amp;quot; went on Alexander in
a panic, his mind flooding with pictures of his wife,
his children, his happy home. &amp;quot;It's impossible—
utterly impossible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But you can get it,&amp;quot; suggested Lawson quietly.
And though his voice sounded determined, merciless
even, there was that odd touch of reluctance again
in his manner, as though he was ashamed to say the
words. He stood there on the office carpet, watching
his victim's face, giving him time apparently.
Putting the letters back into his pocket, he waited
in silence. A hint of contempt, it may be, lay in
this silence, contempt for the other's craven attitude
and lack of fight. And Alexander somehow was
aware of this, even while he tried frantically to
think out ways and means. He would have paid
£1,000, let alone £20, to have those letters back
and see them burn. But where could he find £20
at a moment's notice? Though recovering a little
from the first awful shock, his mind worked badly.
He did think once of the Law which allowed a
plaintiff in a blackmail case to conceal his name.
He also thought of threatening to go to the police
at once. Only the pluck to carry the bluff through
failed him—and he knew it. He was so terrified,
so painfully anxious to get those letters back that
he kept his mind chiefly on the £20 and where in
the devil he could find it. The name of a pal who
might lend it crossed his bewildered mind at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you will come back in an hour, in half an
hour even,&amp;quot; he said at last in a low, stammering
voice, &amp;quot;I—I think I can have it for you.&amp;quot; Without
knowing exactly why, he suddenly added then:
&amp;quot;You're a—gentleman, I see.&amp;quot; The words came on
their own accord. Lawson lowered his eyes. He
didn't answer. &amp;quot;If you go out,&amp;quot; he said then quietly,
&amp;quot;I'm afraid I must come with you. I'm sorry—but
—you understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, yes, I understand—of course,&amp;quot; said the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end this is what happened. They went out
together. Alexander, greatly to his surprise, got his
£20. They came back together, always side by side.
Alexander handed over the money and took the
letters in his hand. He counted them. He was
shaking so violently that he had to count them a
second time. One, two, three! The cold sweat broke
out on him afresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Three,&amp;quot; he whispered. &amp;quot;Is that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; you've got?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson, he saw, actually blushed. He was already
at the door on his way out. &amp;quot;I think so,&amp;quot; he replied,
forcing the pleasant smile on to his face as he told
the deliberate lie. &amp;quot;I'll look again when I get home,
and if there is another you shall have it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expression on the face startled Alexander, for
behind the forced smile, behind the sudden blush,
was misery—abject misery. The hideous shame was
clear to see, but the grim determination too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another … ?&amp;quot; repeated Alexander.&amp;quot; But you've
got a lot more—a dozen at least … &amp;quot; he cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lawson was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander sat motionless for some minutes,
clutching the letters feverishly as though they
might be snatched away. He had gone to pieces
badly. How the man had come into possession of
the horrible letters puzzled him utterly. But that
did not matter: he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; got them, and he, Alexander,
had written them—oh, a dozen at least, perhaps
two dozen. Twenty pounds for three! With more to
follow! He thought of his wife, his children, his
happy home. … He thought of Lawson—his voice,
his manner, his whole attitude. A gentleman, yes,
a man of education and refinement. That sudden
blush, the nervous, deprecating air, the reluctance,
the look of shame. A man ashamed of yielding to
the temptation chance has put in his way, eager
to get away the moment the hideous deal was over
and the money in his pocket. Yet a man, Alexander
now began too late to realize, he might have bargained
and pleaded with. The fellow's better nature
was plain to see—underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander cursed himself for his collapse and
lack of pluck. A bold front, a threat of the police,
and Lawson in his turn would have weakened,
possibly collapsed himself. A good bluff and Alexander
might have got those letters—all of them,
not merely three—for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telephone rang. He realized he still sat
clutching his three letters, and that it was office
hours and he had much to do. But the instant he
was free again, he quickly locked the door and lit
a match. He burnt the letters—without reading
them—and smudged the black ashes into dust in
his waste-paper basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still trembling with the shock and horror of it
all, he could not work. He took the afternoon off,
walking feverishly round and round the parks,
thinking feverishly, but without result. The night
at home was the most miserable he had ever known,
the children on his knee, the wife he loved beside
him. If he slept at all, he hardly knew it. He had
come, however, to a decision—to two in fact.
And next day he went to a solicitor, putting a
hypothetical case before him. But the strong advice
to go straight to the police was beyond his powers.
Even as &amp;quot;Mr. X,&amp;quot; he could not face a trial. His
second decision was to plead with Lawson, plead for
time at any rate. The man had a better nature he
felt he could appeal to. He would do this—the next
time. For he knew, of course, there would be a
next time. Lawson before long would call again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lawson did not call again. After weeks of
unspeakable terror and anguish, a letter came, to
his home address this time. It was very brief, the
handwriting rather suggesting the scholar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; come across another letter. Perhaps you would prefer
to call for it yourself. A fiver would meet the case. I do not
wish to cause unnecessary pain. It is, apparently, the only one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The address was in Kilburn, and Alexander took
five Treasury notes and went, one thing comforting
him a little—the obvious fact, namely that Lawson
was not a thoroughgoing and experienced blackmailer,
or he would never have taken risks and laid
himself open to such an easy trap. In his mind he
had already rehearsed what he meant to say. His
plea would be as moving as only truth could make
it. But he planned a threat as well, a bluff of course,
but a bluff that would sound genuine—that if
driven to kill himself, he would leave the evidence
behind him and Lawson would be at once arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could be firm this time, with the firmness of
a desperate man. Desperate indeed he was, but
firmness did not belong to his weak, impulsive,
rather nerveless type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting a block of cheap flats, or a single room
in a mean lodging-house, he found instead a small
detached building, quite a decent little place, and
a deaf old woman admitted him, announcing him
by name, into a room that looked half study, half
library. For it held numerous books, and a writing-table
was covered with papers. Lawson, at the far
end of it, stood to receive him. But the interview
hardly went according to plan, for as Alexander
handed over the Treasury notes and received the
letter in exchange, the other again took the cash as
with a kind of shrinking, horrible reluctance. He
was trembling, his face was very white, his voice,
as he said &amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; trembled too. And before
Alexander could recover from his moment's surprise
and bring out either his plea or his threat, Lawson
was speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm in a terrible position myself,&amp;quot; he said in a
very low voice, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Terrible.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; His face expressed real
anguish. &amp;quot;With any luck,&amp;quot; he went on in a whisper,
his eyes on the floor, &amp;quot;I would repay you—one day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He placed the notes in a drawer of his desk, while
Alexander's eye, watching the movement, read the
titles of some books above: a volume of Matthew
Arnold's poems, a Greek lexicon, Gibbon's &lt;em&gt;Decline
and Fall&lt;/em&gt;. But it was Lawson's sign of weakness
that then helped the other to find some, at least,
of the words he had meant to use. It was the bluff
that rose first to the surface of his bewildered mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know—that I can go to the police,&amp;quot; he
heard himself saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other looked sideways towards the window,
so that Alexander caught the face at a new angle.
He noticed the ravaged expression. Lawson was
suffering intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know,&amp;quot; came the reply calmly, without turning
the head. &amp;quot;But you wouldn't—any more than I
would.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conviction in the words, their truth as well,
confused and bewildered the wretched victim still
more. His thoughts scattered hopelessly. He said
the first thing that came into his head. All idea of
a plea for mercy had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you drive me to kill myself—and I'm near it
now—you'd be arrested at once. I could leave the
proofs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the way Lawson shrugged his shoulders
that completed his feeling of utter hopelessness. It
had dawned upon him suddenly that Lawson's
position was somehow similar to his own, his desperation
as dreadful. Lawson himself was at the last
gasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You've got a lot more, of course?&amp;quot; he heard
himself asking in a faint voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson now turned and faced him. His expression
was awful, if pitiful at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm afraid so,&amp;quot; he whispered, and his manner
again showed that deep reluctance, with a sort of
shame and horror against himself. &amp;quot;One or two—
I'm afraid,&amp;quot; he repeated. He drew a heavy sigh
and put up his hand to hide his eyes. &amp;quot;I'm
frightfully sorry,&amp;quot; he muttered, half to himself. He
was trembling from head to foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview was over. Alexander left the house
an utterly hopeless man. The situation was now
clear to him, of course. Lawson, normally a decent
fellow probably, was being blackmailed himself.
Alexander understood, he even sympathized, but
with this understanding vanished the last vestige also
of any hope. He realized now &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; how desperate
Lawson was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ghastly suffering and anguish of the weeks
and months that followed need no description—his
sleeplessness, his frantic resorts to finding cash, the
moneylenders, his wife's discovery that something
very serious was wrong, the way he fobbed her off
with a story of bad business. The visits to Kilburn
were repeated and repeated, though the interview
usually took place in silence now. Money was paid,
letters were handed over—without a word, both
men, indeed, seemed approaching the last gasp. As
for Alexander, he found it difficult to believe that
he had written so many letters. But he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect at last broke his life to
pieces. His health was gone, his mind became queer.
Turning frantically to one desperate plan after
another, all of them useless, he was driven finally
into that dreadful, final corner where an Emergency
Exit seemed inevitable. And this was not nerve, it
was merely the ultimate decision of an utterly
ruined, ordinary man. He bought a pistol. In his
mind came the mad suggestion that it was as easy
to end two lives as one. He went to the little Kilburn
house for the last time. This was definitely to be
his last visit. He took no money with him, but in
his hip-pocket lay the Browning with three cartridges
in the chamber—the third in case of mischance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how he intended to act was far from clear
to him. He had rehearsed no plan. That time was
past. The loaded pistol lay in his pocket. He left
the rest to impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an evening in late October, summertime
now over, and dusk spread over the dreary Kilburn
streets. He came straight from the office by Tube.
After leaving the train he walked very rapidly.
Then he broke into a run, with the feeling that the
faster he went the sooner the awful thing would
be over. He arrived panting, reaching the house
almost before he knew it. He was utterly distraught,
his mind, even his senses, behaving wildly, inaccurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no answer to the violent pull he gave
the bell, the deaf old woman did not appear, and
then he noticed for the first time that the front door
stood ajar. And he just walked in. The tiny hall was
empty too. He closed the door behind him and
walked across to the library. Only too well he knew
it. There was no need to be shown in. He was
expected. And he was punctual. Six was striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house, it then occurred to him, was exceptionally
quiet. There was an extraordinary stillness about
it—a stillness he didn't like. There was also—though
he only recalled this afterwards—a faint odour of a
peculiar kind. Giving a loud knock without waiting
for an answer, he opened it the same instant and
walked straight in without further ado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw Lawson at once. He was not standing as
usual, but sitting facing him in the leather armchair
with its patches of untidy horsehair sticking out.
And he declares that the moment his eyes rested
on him a disagreeable shudder ran down his spine.
It was not the shudder of loathsome anxiety he
knew so well, but something he had never felt
before. Distracted, half crazy though his mind undoubtedly
was at the time, it took in one thing at
least quite clearly. Lawson looked different. He had
changed. Wherein this alteration lay exactly Alexander
could not say. He only knew that it frightened
him in a new way and that his back had goose-flesh.
An awful fear crawled over him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson not only looked different—he behaved
differently. He did not get up, but sat in the chair
staring into his visitor's face. There was something
wrong, not merely different. And Alexander stopped
dead just inside the door, forgetting even to close
it behind him. He stood there spellbound, returning
the stare. His first instinct was to turn tail and run,
only his legs felt suddenly weak, his control of the
muscles gone. He held his breath. What amazed
him more than anything else was the expression on
his enemy's face. For it wore a happy, kindly smile;
the ravaged, suffering look had left it, there lay
a curious soft pity on it. Unaccountably, he felt his
heart beginning to swell. He could not take his eyes
from that happy, pitiful face, that motionless figure
in the chair. It was perhaps two minutes, perhaps
only two seconds, before he heard the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Lawson spoke—in a scarcely audible whisper.
There was obviously a tremendous strain and effort
behind the whisper, as though he could only just
manage it: yet Alexander heard every syllable
distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You won't need that pistol, either for me or for
yourself. I have posted the others to you—with what
—money I had. …&amp;quot; and the whisper died away
into silence. The lips still moved, but no sound came
from them. Lawson himself had not moved at all—
he had not made even the smallest movement—
once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sound in the hall, and Alexander
involuntarily turned his head an instant. He recognized
the deaf woman's shuffling tread. Turning
back to the room again almost the same moment,
Lawson the blackmailer was no longer staring at
him from the leather chair. He was not in the chair
at all. He was not even in the room. The room was
empty. The only visible living person in it was
himself, Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It flashed across him, as the deaf servant came
stumbling through the door behind him, that he
had gone crazy, that his mind was gone. There was
icy perspiration all over him. He was shaking
violently. He heard the old woman's words in a
confused jumble only, but their meaning was plain
enough. Lawson, she was trying to tell him, had
shot himself several hours ago … but had not
killed himself … the police … doctors had come
… there had been an anaesthetic … he had
been taken away … but had died in the ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander does not remember how he got out of
the house. All he remembers is walking the streets
furiously, for hours even, and somewhere or other
telephoning to his wife that he was detained and
would not be home till after dinner. He knows he
did that. He knows also that on reaching the house
very late, he talked incoherently to his frightened
wife, that the children were long since in bed and
asleep, and that his wife put a registered packet
into his trembling hands in due course. He knows
too that it contained several letters he had written
years before to another woman—dreadful, damaging
letters—that a couple of twenty-pound notes fell at
his feet, and that the postmark on the label was
11.30 Kilburn that very morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The November fog drifted in oily spirals
over the region of Gorston Square.
It hung obstinately, reluctant to be
disturbed. In Victorian days the Square
had been almost fashionable. Rich merchant
princes and rising barristers inhabited
its rather grim-looking houses, where now
there was hardly a single private dwelling
to be seen. The old buildings had sunk
into cheap boarding-houses or small hotels
of doubtful character, with a few bleak
erections converted into so-called modern
flats. No wonder the fog lingered and felt
at home in Gorston Square. It offered cover
to more than one transient who welcomed
cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the steps of the dingiest of these
hotels, the Gorston Arms, stood a man who
had all the appearance of one of these uneasy
transients. He seemed part of the fog and
gloom and murk: a tall, dark man with
hunched shoulders, a pasty, discoloured face
and shifty eyes. A scar ran from his jaw
across the left cheek almost to his ear, a
scar he cursed bitterly because no medical
skill had been able to obliterate it. It had
been acquired several years before in Denver
City from a razor-blade, fixed in a potato,
and its grim signature, intended for his
throat, had been diverted only because his
famous left arm had been a fraction of a
second too quick. That famous pugilist's
left had saved his life, but for a crook like
Lefty Holt it was a damaging mark to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefty was glad of the fog that night, as
he stood on the steps of the Gorston Arms
and sniffed the choking air. Looking right
and left, he eyed the street uneasily, watching
the few figures that moved so cautiously
about their business through the murk.
What was their business, was the question
he asked himself. He preferred to see them
moving rather than just loitering. For
Lefty knew, with the strange, keen instinct
of the hunted, that for days he had been
shadowed. The fellow gangsters he had
&amp;quot;let down&amp;quot; in Denver City were on his
trail. He was being followed, and this
uncanny instinct of the hunted would not
let him rest. He had spotted no one in
particular, but he was positive they were
on his heels. He had been tracked across
the water, for they knew that, as a Britisher,
he would make for London. The warning
whisper ran through his bones and blood:
his temporary hotel was no longer safe. A
chance caller, and before he even knew what
the visitor wanted, the knife would be in
his ribs. He must at once find lodgings
where he could more easily check new
arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefty Holt, crook and double-crosser,
hid behind the shelter of the porch and
studied the roadway carefully, peering about
him into the welcome fog. Few people,
thank God, were on the move, but he would
not venture forth till he made quite sure
there was no suspicious figure loitering on
a corner. A postman passed on his rounds,
sure of each familiar step; a youth on a
bicycle, obviously some clerk hurrying home
to his supper or high tea; a blind man tapping
along the pavement by the Square railings,
safer than any pedestrian, since darkness
was his natural condition. A rare taxi
crawled slowly by. The outlook seemed
safe enough—reasonably safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefty slipped out swiftly, and in a moment
the fog had swallowed him up. In his
pocket lay one or two addresses he had
sifted that morning from likely papers. He
moved rapidly. He did
not make the mistake
of looking behind him
or over his shoulder,
but his eyes, for all
that, were wide open
in his back, nerves
and instinct as alert
as a wolf's. The
postman, the clerk,
were gone, and the
blind man went as
before, tapping his
dreadful stick, though
the note had slightly
changed, and the taps
came at longer intervals.
He, too, was
moving away. Two
men slid out from the
doorway of an office-building
lower down
the street and disappeared,
but they,
too, went in the opposite
direction. The
blind man no longer
tapped, for he was
round the corner.
Lefty felt safe. He
could go now and
inspect the lodgings
he had in view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor was the region unfamiliar to him.
It was here in boyhood he had learned his
first pick-pocketing; the police court a
few hundred yards beyond the Square he
remembered, too; against these very railings
on fragrant summer nights he had courted
the girl he took later to Colorado as his wife,
a crook even smarter than he was himself.
His face darkened at the thought. Mean-hearted
double-crosser though he was, the
knowledge that she in turn had given him
the same treatment filled his heart with
vicious rage. She had got away with it,
too, stones and all, his own share into the
bargain. Yet she, too, he reflected, if she
ever got clear of the Denver City gang,
would make for these same parts and comparative
safety. Beasts in danger, he knew,
invariably return to their familiar haunts
where &amp;quot;hides&amp;quot; and funk-holes are known
to them. Thoughts and memories ran on
through his mind in their nasty circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He almost collided with a burly figure in
blue standing motionless beneath a lamppost,
and instinctively his coat collar went
up to hide that scar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Evening, mate,&amp;quot; he said gruffly, without
turning his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thick night, ain't it?&amp;quot; came the answer,
as Lefty passed on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a policeman had no terrors for him
at the moment, though it was just as well
his face should not be recognised. He was
not &amp;quot;wanted&amp;quot; here. He had done no
violence in his early days, only the lesser,
meaner crimes … and ten minutes later
he tried the first address in his list, only to find
that the room advertised was already taken.
Luck failed him at the next house, too; and
at the third he rang and rang for some
time without an answer. He tried the
knocker, for he was getting impatient, and
waiting, he felt, was dangerous. Though
the fog was now so thick that it was difficult
to see even across the street, or ten yards
along the pavement, he felt exposed and
defenceless, as though he stood naked on
the doorstep Yet he persisted, for some
instinct told him this was the house he
wanted. The door opened suddenly but
cautiously, a few inches only. He liked
that caution, it confirmed his instinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What d'you want 'ere?&amp;quot; came a harsh
voice in his ear, no face yet visible. It
was a woman's voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an instant, Lefty almost lost his self-possession,
but for an instant only. If
anyone should know that voice, he should
He had heard it last in Denver City some
years ago, but he could never fail to recognise
it. It went through him now like a flash
of steel or fire. The hair on his spine, so
to speak, stood up. Questions and suspicions
blazed in him. Had she followed him?
Had she, too, made her own get-away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who's in there with you—Lizzie?&amp;quot;
his snarling voice asked with a filthy oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;N-no one,&amp;quot; came the reply, after an
instant's hesitation he did not fail to notice.
&amp;quot;But I don't want you,&amp;quot; she snapped,
trying to shut the door in his face, without
success, for his foot had already jammed
it. A second later he had forced his way
inside and slammed the door behind him,
and the horrid pair stood facing one another
in the dim-lit little hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's no good, kid,&amp;quot; said Lefty, in a
voice now ominously softer. &amp;quot;We got to
have a show-down, you and me,&amp;quot; and he
gave her a cruel blow across the mouth with
the famous left that had earned him his
name. As the woman, scared to death,
staggered back against the hat-rack, protecting
her face from further blows that,
however, did not follow. Lefty swept the
hall with quick, cunning eyes. No hat,
he saw, was hanging there, though that did
not mean there was no man about. He
might just be out. His hand strayed to his
left arm-pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And where's Shearer?&amp;quot; he asked
again, in that ominous soft voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dead,&amp;quot; whispered the woman, white
with terror, &amp;quot;these two years gone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefty examined her face very closely in
the dim light for some seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He's lucky,&amp;quot; he observed. &amp;quot;Maybe
he had a sweeter death than what I had
waiting for him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman, shivering from head to
foot, said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's only one thing I want from
you, Lizzie,&amp;quot; Lefty went on threateningly,
&amp;quot;but I want it quick. You two sure played
me for the blind sucker I was. Where are
the stones?&amp;quot; He slipped the gun neatly
from his armpit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman's voice had gone, so that
it was barely audible. &amp;quot;Upstairs,&amp;quot; she
managed to whisper, pointing overhead with
a hand that shook like a leaf. &amp;quot;I kept
your share for you, Lefty, all this time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like hell you did,&amp;quot; snarled Lefty with
an ugly grin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'll get them for you,&amp;quot; came her terrified
whisper, with eyes on the pointing gat
in his hand, as she began to move. After
a moment's hesitation, Lefty decided to
let her go alone. Knowing her as he did,
he felt her terror was real, and instinct
assured him there was no man in the
house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And move fast,&amp;quot; he told her savagely,
fingering his gun. &amp;quot;No funny stuff, either,
or you'll get what's coming to you,&amp;quot; he
added, with a flood of blasphemy, as he
watched her backing clumsily up the stairs.
&amp;quot;Too hot to cash in, I suppose,&amp;quot; he threw
after her, referring to the stones,&amp;quot; too hot
for a — — like you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nasty expression ran down his lop-sided
face like a streak of fire or poison. He
watched her go, counting each step as she
stumbled up, yet his eyes simultaneously
everywhere in turn, his ears intent for the
slightest suspicious sound. He said no
further word. He felt certain she still
had the stones, or some of them, and would
bring them down. He saw her turn the
corner along the dark, narrow landing, and
when she was out of sight, though still
listening closely to the sound of her footsteps,
he turned away and looked cautiously
about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A door faced him, and he flung it wide
open with a rapid sudden gesture, but he
did not enter the room till he was quite
certain it was empty. He saw a fire burning
in the grate, a round table in the centre
with books lying open and a few children's
toys. A wooden elephant, a golliwog, a
tiny aeroplane, lay beneath his eyes. A
child's room, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She's got a kid, I do believe,&amp;quot; darted
across his mind. &amp;quot;And Shearer's, by God,
unless I'm crazy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was surprised at himself. After all
this time—what could it possibly matter?
But—it did matter. For the blood in his
veins boiled up till it almost frothed. Never
before had he felt such a storm of wild,
animal rage. Ungovernable fury rose in him,
yet with it something cold as ice, a combination
that made the blood ebb and flow
strangely, making the scar across his face
a livid streak, the face itself a devil's
face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He listened. Overhead he could hear
her shuffling about, drawers being opened,
furniture moved, but there was no one with
her, and only one pair of feet went stumbling
across that upper floor. He was quite
positive of that. He kept his wolf's ears
divided between that upper floor, the corridor
outside and the front-door step. His gat
was ready pointing for instant use if
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a door opened suddenly in the hall,
and he froze to attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mummie, where are you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply came down: &amp;quot;In a minute, darling! Coming!&amp;quot;
And a little boy entered the room, smiling and unafraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you the new lodger?&amp;quot; asked the little fellow, as he
looked the tall stranger over with a fearless eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, no—I guess not,&amp;quot; said Lefty in his gentlest voice.
&amp;quot;I just called in to see your ma. You see,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;I used
to know her a long time back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child listened with rather an examining expression, then
turned his eyes to his toys on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look what she gave me for my birfday,&amp;quot; he exclaimed proudly,
unearthing something Lefty had not noticed before among the
others. &amp;quot;A real pistol, like they have in the movies. Isn't it
grand? Hands up, or I shoot!&amp;quot; he added, trying to look fierce
and determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lefty was watching the child closely, his face working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why, say!&amp;quot; he cried, &amp;quot;isn't that just fine! It covers the
heart every time, don't it just!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You bet it does,&amp;quot; laughed the child, playing with it.
And Lefty knew. The same eyes, the same ears, the same set
of the head upon the neck. It was Shearer's kid all right. The
child of his pal, the pal who had stolen his wife, his share of the
jewel-robbery as well, and skipped, leaving him, Lefty, to dodge
the cops and make his get-away as best he could without a cent.
There was no doubt about it in his mind. The proof faced him
here and now, and his blood rose to its maximum of bitter fury.
Only one idea lay in his being—revenge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He heard Lizzie's footsteps stumbling down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quick,&amp;quot; he said to the boy, with a smile, taking his gun from
his pocket, &amp;quot;we'll play your mother a grand trick. It's a great
idea. You take my pistol—it's just a toy like yours, only
heavier and bigger—and when she comes in you just point it at
her and cry, &amp;quot;Hands up, you villain!&amp;quot; and then fire. And she'll
fall down and pretend to be dead just like they do in the movies.
And then I'll arrest you, and we'll all laugh together! What
d'you say, boy—eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, that'll be fun!&amp;quot; cried the boy, eagerly taking the
automatic Lefty handed to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It sure will,&amp;quot; agreed Lefty, putting the catch at ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why, it's ever so much heavier than mine.&amp;quot; said the little
fellow admiringly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure. It's the latest toy-model,&amp;quot; Lefty told him. &amp;quot;Hold it
steady against that book now. There! That's fine. Then point
straight, and pull the trigger quick, remember. It'll go quite easy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman came in with a large envelope in her hand. &amp;quot;Here
they are,&amp;quot; she whispered, glancing a moment at her child as
though in uneasy surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hands up, you villain!&amp;quot; she heard in the boy's excited voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pistol cracked. She slithered to the floor, the envelope
fell towards Lefty's feet. He stared at it a moment, watching
the blood pouring from the woman's mouth, then swiftly picked
it up, stuffed it into his pocket, and passed out into the hall.
The pistol he deliberately left behind him. A moment later he
was lost in the fog outside, the excited laughter of the boy still
ringing in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shearer's kid,&amp;quot; he muttered, wiping the icy perspiration from
his forehead. &amp;quot;And serve her damn well right! She got what
was coming to her at last!&amp;quot; But he was trembling from head
to foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He moved fast, soon entering Gorston Square. He would find
a room to-morrow. The fog was thicker than ever. So much
the better, he thought, clutching the big envelope tightly in his
pocket and feeling the hard edges of what it contained. There
was no single pedestrian about, though he heard again the
tapping of that blind man's stick as he fumbled along by the icy
railings. And this time he did not like the sound. A violent
shiver ran over him. At the corner two other lost pedestrians
came towards him. They slipped up uncomfortably close, one
on either side. Too late he realised the meaning of that blind
man's tapping stick. There was a swift gleam of steel. His
hand, whipping to his arm-pit, found it empty—too late again,
for he had lent his gun to a little boy. The two figures vanished
in the fog, but Lefty lay quite still against the icy railings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreigners — they're all
mad!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even the English?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mad as hatters!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Germans too?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course—Jew mad!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what about the French?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well—I guess I used to think
them a pretty sane crowd till I
came across the St. Jooles affair.
After that I saw that they were
as mad as all the rest—a bit more,
even!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the fat man in the corner
of the Smoking Room on
Deck A who was talking. Why, I
asked myself, is there always a fat
man in the corner of the Smoking
Room on board these liners? I
don't know, but there always is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were three days out from
Southampton on the Borotania.
Our particular Fat Man sat in
his corner, a huge cigar stuck
between his thick lips, and surrounded
by a crew of satellites for
whom he bought drinks at frequent
intervals, provided they
would listen to his stories. They
did. I am bound to admit that
he was an amusing fat man, and
evidently rich. His crowd stuck
to him like leeches. I myself constantly
took a seat just outside
the sacred circle on purpose to
listen to his stories, which grew
more and more racy as the evening
progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this particular night he was
at the top of his form; I could
tell by the way he twirled the big
cigar and by the flush on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell us about St. Jules,&amp;quot; suggested
one of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fat man glanced round to
see if the circle was worth while,
Apparently it was. He blew out
a thick cloud of smoke, ordered
a round of drinks, smacked his
lips, and started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; he began confidentially,
as the way is with good storytellers,
&amp;quot;I guess some of you
boys know the little burg as it is
now, but, believe me, three years
ago it was some town. Folks talk
a lot about Monte, but in those
days St. Jooles sure had it beaten
to a frazzle. The play at Monte
was pretty high, I know, but at
St. Jooles it was too high to see
the top. And the town was wide
open from dark to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I'm telling you—they
were a hard-boiled lot when I
first hit the town. Everything
was going full blast and a bit over.
I went to the old Continental
Hotel where I always stayed, and
the very first person I ran into
after checking in was Mossy Mason.
And I was sure glad to see old
Mossy. Mossy had been my sidekick
in a good many deals when
we were together back in god's
country. We liquored up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After a bit, he took me aside
to a quiet spot outside on the
verandah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Tommy', he says, 'you're
just in time, but not a minute to
spare.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'And the rest, Mossy?' I
enquires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;It's like this,' he says, 'I've
got a real good thing, and you
must come in with me.' And he
gives me the quick once-over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Mossy,' I told him right
away, 'I don't want any of your
sure-fire-systems-to-beat-the-bank.
I have had some and, believe me,
I have had a plenty.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm with you,' he explains.
'But this is the real thing.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Get on with it, then,' from
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I've got a wop,' he goes on,
'with an advertising stunt that
will bring in the mazurka every
time.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Let's have the low-down,' I
asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'This is the way of it,' he
tells me then. 'The wop has
invented a machine that'll throw
letters on the sky over a mile long.
Bright as god's own fire they are.
And they'll knock out all the
electric signs that were ever made.
They just shake the guts out of
you with terror.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'Now, see here,' I says.
'That's an old stunt. Folks have
been trying to do that since Nero
played the fiddle, and nothing ever
came of it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'The scale was too small,' he
explains. 'That was the trouble.
Now, to-morrow night we 're going
back into the hills with a lorry,
he and I, and, believe me, we're
going to show this town something
it's never seen before.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, his stuff impressed me
some, and I asked what was he
going to do it with, this great
inventor-wop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'A new sort of ray,&amp;quot; he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought it over a bit,
but I wanted to see the goods
before going in with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's O.K. with me,' I says
finally, for I always make my mind
up quick, 'but I got to see it first.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He looks me over. 'That's the stuff,'
he says. 'I never knew you miss a real
chance. You be down,' he goes on, 'on the
terrace here to-morrow night,' he says, 'and
we ll show you.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it was after he left me that I
bumped into as nice a strawberry
blonde as you 'll find, and she sure kept me
amused the rest of the evening—only that
is another story, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And next day Mossy introduced me to
his wop. He was a clever-looking guy called
Cavallo. He was full of his invention, and,
like all inventors, was soon talking in millions
of francs. It's a way they have, you know.
They could never invent anything unless
they were half-batty to start with. Still,
he made me feel there was something in it.
He tried hard to explain the thing to me
but it was too technical and I couldn't get
it. Never mind, I told him. 'You show it
to me to-night and it will be O.K. with me.'
And he said 'Benissimo' or 'spaghetti,' or
something like that, drank up his mineral
water, and made off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And about ten o'clock that night, sure
enough, a lorry came along loaded with
machinery of sorts, and Mossy and Cavallo
climbs in. They told me they aimed to get
well away into the back country, so that no
one could see them doing their stuff. It was
a hell of an ascent, all hairpin bends right up
to the top of the mountain, and Cavallo
turns to me just as they push off. 'I'm
going to give this town the scare of its life,'
he says. They need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'That's all right with me,' I says.
'They do. Scare hell out of them if you
can.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;'I do that,' he replies—and they push off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I got two hours to fill in, so I go look
for my blonde, and we fill in time at the
Casino. I run into a streak of luck and the
time passes very quickly. So I drag my
blonde out of the rooms about a quarter of
twelve and we sit on the terrace. We did
not know it then, of course, but that was the
very last night the Casino was open. Naturally,
I didn't say a word about the show I
was expecting from the mountains, but as
the minutes slipped by I began to get a
bit anxious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fat Man stopped and yelled to the
steward to bring more drinks all round. And
it was while he was doing this that I noticed,
sitting in my corner, that a dark, foreign-looking
fellow with a black beard had slipped
into the chair beside me. He was obviously
French, judging by the Maryland cigarette
he was smoking with pleasure. Obviously,
too, he had been listening to Fatty's story
and was very much amused by what he
heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steward having served the drinks,
Fatty took a couple of good-sized gulps and
went on with his yarn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where was I, boys? Oh, yes; I had the
blonde parked on the terrace. Well, I'm
telling you I had a job to keep her there.
She tried all the time to sting me for a mille
and get back to the rooms, but I wasn't
having any. I worked hard to get her to
look at the lovely night—how the moon
shone on the water, how swell a cruise-boat
looked as it passed out to sea all lit up,
how the lights of the fishing boats in the
harbour twinkled. But, I tell you, she was
difficult to hold. And all the time the
minutes were slipping away and nothing
happened. It got to twelve-thirty, and I
thought something must have gone wrong
with all that apparatus they took up into
those steep mountains—accident, maybe, or
something. Twelve-forty came, and then
suddenly the quiet of the night was shattered.
A terrible voice roared from the clouds:
'REPENT! REPENT!' and at the same
time the words were repeated in flaming
letters a mile long in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I tell you, boys, I was scared dumb
myself, The voice was really awful. It seemed
to go right through you, and for a moment I
got the appalling notion it must be God
speaking. The Frenchies were scared to
death, as well they might be. They tore out
of the Casino like cattle was stampeding—
out of all the restaurants and dance halls
they came pouring in a rush and went
flopping on their knees in the square by
hundreds. A terrible sigh rose from the whole
crowd as the voice began to thunder out
again, but I can't tell you what it said, as
I guess it was Italian, and anyway, I was
too scared to take it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then silence. A silence you could feel.
The sky and the night were empty again—
just quiet stars and deep blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was I pleased? I'll say I was, now that
my nerves were steady again. I was right
on a winner, I knew. I was feeling generous,
so I slipped the blonde a couple of notes
and told her to beat it. Believe it or not,
she was still on her knees, but she kind of
regained consciousness when I crackled the
notes by her ear. She stopped praying for a
moment to shove the notes down her dress—
what there was of it—and then went at it
again, praying like a loud-speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I left her to it, and walked to the hotel,
treading on air. I felt kind of sorry for all
those punks still praying in the square, as
I mixed myself a high-ball, but I thought
they were a hard-boiled lot and a little spot
of praying couldn't do them any harm. I
guess most of them hadn't prayed for twenty
years, if ever. I got a good laugh when I
thought about Charles, the head waiter.
Not many guys can boast that they've seen
a head waiter pray I Anyway, I would put
it all right with them next day. I'd tell
them it was only a stunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that's just where I went wrong.
They wouldn't believe me. That's what
shook me about the French, as I mentioned
at the beginning of this story. I had always
thought the French were logical and would
listen to reason, but these Froggies all got
mad as blazes when I told them the truth.
&amp;quot;No, no!' they cried, and whispered, 'It
was God'—le bon Doo, as they called Him.
Even Charles went on the same way. I
told him after breakfast that I'd bring the
boys round who had worked the stunt, but
he' just smiled in a superior way and, by
God, he had the last laugh, too!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why? How was that?&amp;quot; cut in some of
his listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because those two blasted fools came
down that mountain road in the dark too
fast and had smashed up the lorry and killed
themselves. That's why and how it was.
Can you beat it for bad luck? And that's
why St. Jools still believes in the Miracle
of the Voice, as they call it, and how it got
reformed. They're building a church now
to the Voice. Anyway, the little burg is no
use now to any American citizen who aims
to see Europe!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty stopped. The black-bearded Frenchman
in the chair beside me was shaking all
over, and when I turned I saw tears running
down his cheeks. Never before or since
have I seen a guy laugh as that Frenchie
laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's the matter?&amp;quot; I asked him.
&amp;quot;It was a good story. I don't see what's
so terribly funny about it—&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wiped his eyes and recovered his breath.
&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; he said in a low voice, &amp;quot;you see,
I've heard it before many, many times—'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Heard &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; tell it, you mean?&amp;quot; I asked
in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mais oui,&amp;quot; he whispered, no longer
laughing now. &amp;quot;He used to tell it every
night three years ago when he was staying
with me—&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In your house?&amp;quot; I interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded. &amp;quot;I was in charge of him in
the St. Jules Private Lunatic Asylum.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is odd how trivial a thing can cause a first, instinctive dislike:
the way a man wears his hat, the smirk with which
a woman uses her mirror and lipstick in a public place —
and the aversion is suddenly aroused. Later knowledge may
justify this first dislike, but the actual start has been the
merest triviality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some think, however, this cause has not been so trivial
as it appears; that gesture, being an unconscious expression
of the entire personality, may betray far more than speech,
which is calculated. Moleson, thinking over the brusqueness
of the stranger on the doorstep, the unnecessary way he
pushed ahead of him and up the stairs, his whole air, indeed,
of general resentment and disapproval, found himself
recalling a rather significant answer that a very wise old
man had once given in his hearing to a commonplace question.
The question was not his own: he was listening to
two friends discussing a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Everything indicates,' said the first, carelessly enough,
'that I ought to like X. I have nothing against him. Quite the
reverse, in fact. Yet I do not like him. I simply cannot like
him, try as I will. Now — why don't I?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Your dislike,' was the reply, 'is probably chemical.
Merely chemical.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came back to Moleson's mind now, as he unpacked his
things and arranged himself in the top-floor bed-sitting room
he had engaged that afternoon. It was in Bloomsbury, close
to the British Museum. The November twilight was setting
in; the gas, electric light stopping at the second floor, was
poor; his reading lamp was not yet unpacked. 'Chemical!
… ' he thought. 'I wonder! … ' as he looked out a moment
into the rather dismal street, where the Museum buildings
blocked the sky with their sombre and formidable mass.
He had, of course, the layman's vague knowledge of the
loves and hates of atoms, their intense attraction and repulsion
for each other, the dizzy rapidity with which they
rushed towards, or away from, those they respectively liked
or disliked. Had all the atoms of which he was composed,
then, turned their backs instinctively upon those which
made up the stranger's body, racing away at a headlong
speed that caused him this acute and positive discomfort?
Was his instantaneous loathing 'chemical merely? … '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he bustled about arranging his things, his dislike of the
fellow remained vivid and persistent. The recent scene again
passed through his mind in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had called in the morning and interviewed Mrs Smith,
with the result: 'Not at the moment, sir, I 'aven't got a
room free'; then, after a rather curious hesitation, 'But later
a little, maybe'; then more hesitation; 'This afternoon,
per'aps — I — I might be able to manage it — if you could make
it convenient — to call in again … '; whereupon, seeing that
the house was so admirably close to the Reading Room
where his daily work would be, Moleson offered to pay in
advance, but was then quick enough to see that it was not
the question of money alone that troubled the woman. Her
hesitation, he perceived, was not mere independence, nor
was it due to his unprosperous appearance. She wanted a
lodger, clearly enough — if she could 'manage it', whatever
that might mean — and it was not himself that she objected
to. It was, he felt sure, a calculation of sorts she was trying
to make in her own mind. He wisely decided to give her
time to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I'll look in again,' he said, 'about three o'clock, say,' and
he added, with his pleasant smile, that most of his time
would be spent working in the Museum opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on his return in the afternoon that the scene
occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had rung the bell, and was waiting just inside the
narrow hall while the maid hurried downstairs to fetch Mrs
Smith, the street door still ajar behind him, when somebody,
another lodger evidently, pushed past brusquely,
offensively, almost resentfully, half shoving him, yet without
actual contact, from where he stood at the foot of the
Stairs — slightly in the way, perhaps — and without so much
as By your Leave. There might, of course, have been a grunt
of apology, for Moleson was a little deaf, but the man's
attitude made it unlikely, and the pose of the head and
shoulders, the face being turned away and not visible, was
far more of resentful disapproval than of apology. Moleson,
on the instant, loathed him, not because of the rudeness, but
because of some presentment his appearance offered that
stirred an intense, instinctive dislike amounting to positive
repulsion. A moment later, when Mrs Smith arrived, panting
and labouring, the man was up the stairs and out of
sight, but at first the impression left was so vivid that Moleson
would not have been altogether displeased if he had
heard that no room was, after all, available. The contrary,
however, took place. A bargain was struck, money passed
hands, and the room was his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of young men in these circumstances would
probably have given their attention to the landlady, to
whom money must be paid, and on whose goodwill they
must depend for their comfort and the like. Moleson, instead,
found himself thinking only of this rude fellow-lodger.
Over his dinner in a neighbouring restaurant he reflected
that his sudden dislike was odd; he had never set
eyes upon the fellow before, and as yet had not even seen
the face nor heard the voice, yet this loathing had leaped
into being. Revulsion, he called it. Its oddness, of course,
lay in this want of proportion. He gave a passing thought,
too, to his landlady, yet chiefly using her as a means of comparison
with the other. Her rather sombre visage, an overwhelming
melancholy in it, though certainly not attractive,
woke nothing stronger in him than a vague, tolerant sympathy.
He felt no dislike, at any rate; she merely didn't
matter; a worthy soul, he decided, worn into sadness by life.
Whereas the other human being gave him this instinctive,
deep revulsion. Chemical? He wondered. For why, if chemical,
should one unpleasing soul awake pity, and another,
equally unpleasing, stir violent antipathy? …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over his coffee, he dismissed the little puzzle. His room
was admirably close to the Museum; Bloomsbury liked him;
and it was the number in the street — Number eleven — his
Manchester friend and employer had mentioned. The price,
too, suited him, for money was scarce, otherwise he would
not be 'devilling' for another man — looking up certain
seventeenth-century facts for a writer who would probably
clear one thousand pounds over his silly book, yet 'must be
sure of my dates and facts, you know. Your expenses and
five pounds a week, if you'll do it for me. …' The street
and number, close to the Museum, were added. Young Moleson,
ignorant of London, jumped at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was some years before our Great Date this happened.
Jim Moleson, engaged to a sweet girl, and now married to
her, told me the details recently. The War intervened, of
course. He had learnt something. At that time I should have
described him as highly strung, sensitive at any rate, imaginative
certainly, poetic probably. I, his senior by a quarter
of a century, rather believed he wrote 'Celtic' poetry in his
bedroom. The War undeceived us about that type, revealed
them rather: their amazing courage, the splendour of their
'imagination', translated into reckless, inspired action. Jim,
anyhow, was always headstrong, fierce-tempered, 'nasty'
once his feelings were stirred, only these feelings were
usually for others — for a lame dog, an injured cat, a bird in
a cage, an overworked horse. Slights, even insults to himself
he could stand, to the point of cowardice, some thought; but
this was wrong; he was easy-going to that point; beyond it
he saw red and — killed. This savage temper, rarely roused,
and then with a curious suddenness, was an item I overlooked.
But it was a human, not merely an animal, temper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work at the Museum, apparently, absorbed him; no
more painstaking and accurate 'devil' ever devilled; and he
got back to his room, tired mentally and physically. A nice-looking,
upstanding lad with his mop of dark hair and blue
eyes, he soon made a friend of Mrs Smith — over his letters
first: 'Lef' at Number seven,' she informed him, the printed
name of his employer's Institute on the envelope catching
her trained, if mournful, eye perhaps. The postman arst
me, and I thought they was for you,' she explained. So his
slight deafness had again betrayed him, and his employer
had said 'Number seven', instead of 'Number eleven'. They
talked on a bit. He had the feeling she wanted to talk a bit,
but wanted to talk about something in particular, and to
him. He explained about the letters and his troublesome
deafness in one ear; he heard her say 'your glass of porter'
when she actually said, 'hot bath water', and then, after a
nice little chat about the weather, prices, and ''ow times
was changing', he noticed that she suddenly stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was after a week in the house, he told me. The
appalling melancholy of her face came over him, but rather
in a new way; he realized it in some personal sense, I think,
as they stood awkwardly staring at one another, each waiting
for the other to speak, so that through his sensitive,
imaginative mind ran the thought: 'That's no ordinary sadness,
I'll be bound! … ' — and then &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impulse to say something kind rose in him, only he
could think of nothing to say, nothing suitable. It was here
he got his first clear, instinctive impression about this commonplace
woman: that she was interested, namely, to ask
some definite question of him, that, liking and trusting him,
and, further, having watched carefully and waited anxiously
the whole week, she now longed to put this definite query
to him, yet was afraid. The same hesitation he had seen first
on the doorstep showed itself in her face and sorrowful
eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been vaguely aware of this for some time evidently,
but had not recognized it. It was not, he felt sure,
any question about his comfort, for he was old enough to
know that landladies rarely took that risk. Something, none
the less, she wanted to know, something personal to himself.
The suffering in her face made him wonder. A queer
sympathy moved through him. He recalled the stationer
round the corner in Bury Street, when he bought his paper
and materials: 'Oh yes, I know, sir; that's Mrs Warley's,'
saying he would send the parcel round, and, being corrected:
'No, Mrs Smith's,' he looked blank a moment, troubled a
little, but in a kindly sense, before he agreed : 'Oh yes, to be
sure, sir — Mrs Smith's — now. So it is. …' That 'now' was
suggestive. She had changed her name, married again, no
doubt, yet there had been trouble of some sort, Moleson
gathered. And, though he had not pursued the matter at
the time, this little memory came back now, as he stood
chatting with her, trying to think of something pleasant he
might say. He wondered …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I'm very comfortable,' he said on impulse, presently.
'The room's just what I wanted —' and he was about to add
some kind and soothing word when she interrupted in an
eager way that startled him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Oh, then everything is all right, sir? There's nothing, I
mean, interfering with your quiet? If anything annoys' -
she changed the verb, before it was completed, to 'disturbs',
then stopped dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not the words — commonplace enough: it was her
face that startled him. It had been on the tip of her tongue,
he felt, to say 'anyone' instead of 'anything'. He knew it in
his bones. Also, she could have cut off that tongue for having
let it say what it &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; said. That, too, he perceived. This question
she longed yet feared to ask had nearly slipped out in
spite of herself. Her face, anyhow, betrayed an emotion that
for an instant obliterated its usual sadness. It was the emotion
of terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson, as he caught it, felt shocked. The sharp instinct
came suddenly to him that it was wiser not to ask. He cut
the talk short, as nicely as he could. 'Nothing, nothing,' he
replied, gave her his pleasant smile, and went up quickly to
his room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her question was an approach to the real one she wanted
so much to ask. That, of course, he realized. Terror lay in
it; it was wrapped round with terror as in a cocoon. Once
the cocoon burst, was broken, out would come all the
hideous wriggling things that lay concealed inside. This was
the feeling Moleson carried upstairs with him. It was as
though he had just caught a glimpse, behind her suddenly
pale skin, of the hideous wriggling things that caused her
sadness and her terror, But another certainty lay in him too
at this moment: the question she had asked, this preliminary
question that was an approach to another, referred — he
felt positive of it — to someone he particularly sought to
keep out of his thoughts as much as ever he could. She referred,
indirectly thus, to the other lodger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was his habit at night, after his dinner round the corner,
to sort out the Notes of his day's work before an early
bed. Tonight, however, this talk stayed by him and prevented.
He sat thinking about it … and eventually, it seems,
thought circling and circling but coming to no satisfactory
conclusion of course, he dropped asleep, to wake very suddenly
much later in a state of uncommon distress — 'acute
distress,' he called it, 'funk'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, I think, is one of the most curious and betraying
things about the whole business: that, even when he told
it all to me later, he kept off that unpleasant lodger, as he
called him — kept him so long in the background. He had
begun by emphasizing his unusual repulsion towards the
fellow, dwelling upon it, stressing it, just as I have done in
this written account. But then, when I was expecting the
lodger to appear in some dreadful and dramatic guise — a
sneak-thief, a forger with coining apparatus, a blackmailer
in league with Mrs Warley-Smith (as I styled her), even a
murderer hiding from the police with the woman's help —
Moleson merely left him out. He ignored him, made no
mention of him. He talked about his work, about Mrs Smith,
his liking the house, yet disliking the room — feeling it disliked
him and wanted him out — about anything except
the sinister lodger. Having first firmly fixed him in my mind
as an ominous character, he just left him there. Thus, when
I tried to bring him to the point — this suggestive point of
the sinister lodger, and a point he had himself established
in opening his tale — he stopped abruptly, and stared into my
face, his features working, his eyes gone positively googly.
Some fear, I saw, still operated in him, unreleased. His face
gave me a touch of goose flesh. There was an ingredient of
salutary 'confession' in his delayed account, I began to
gather. He lowered his voice. 'I knew you'd ask that before
long,' he said. 'You see — I shirked him myself.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Refused to acknowledge him, you mean?' I queried
vaguely. 'Tried to pretend he wasn't in the house?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded, looking down at his boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You disliked him,' I insisted, 'to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; point?' The expression
in his eyes, as he glanced up quickly, answered me
better than his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's unbelievable,' he whispered, 'how that fellow obsessed
me. Obsessed is the term.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if he saw him often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'After that first encounter on the front-door steps — only
twice, all told.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensity, a sort of inner secrecy in him still, made me
hesitate, but as he said nothing, I presently asked boldly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'But — in the end — you found out who he was, what he
was doing there? In a word — why you loathed him so?' I
got no straight answer, but I got the full story, told in his
own evasive, curious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I mentioned how I dropped asleep in my chair, and woke
up suddenly feeling frightened,' he went on. 'Well — that's
the point, you see.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What is?' I asked, justifiably dense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cast his eyes down as though he were ashamed of it.
'I'd been frightened all along,' he muttered. 'Damned
frightened. Ever since I'd been in that awful house, I'd been
frightened.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Of — him?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believed he had discovered why the fellow resented
his being there: it was because Moleson occupied his room.
Mrs Smith had hesitated that first morning whether she could
turn him out or not — his rent probably overdue, and what
not — but eventually had spoken to him — and Moleson, as
described, cash in hand, had moved in. It was a sufficiently
obvious explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'But that didn't explain my own abhorrence — did it?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He may have felt resentful, furious, because I'd got his
room, but that couldn't have made me feel the physical repulsion,
to the point of nausea, which I did feel. And dread
too. I only saw him twice after that first meeting, but
though I saw him so rarely, I knew he was in the house
with me. I never forgot it. He was all over the house expresses
it better. I was always expecting to meet him, to run
across him on the stairs, to find him in the hall. When I
came down the street I imagined him standing on the doorstep,
fumbling with his latchkey. When I went to my bath
halfway down the stairs, I thought we should pass. At night,
if I went out to post a letter; in the morning when I opened
my door to take my hot water in. But, no; he: made no sign,
I did not meet him. What he did all day I have no notion:
he never went out, so far as I saw or knew. But then I myself
was out from nine to five, then again for my dinner
between eight and nine, you see.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a great rate he rattled this off. He gave me a good deal
in a very few words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definite question halted his rambling account, though
it was my object, otherwise, to hear the tale just as he cared
to tell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Describe him?' He repeated my words. 'As I first saw
him —? Oh yes. Though I didn't see the features, remember,
that time.' Then he startled me by raising his voice
most unexpectedly in his excitement: 'Misshapen!' he
shouted in my face, so that I jumped. 'Well, you asked me;
and that's what I felt about him. But mentally, morally,
rather than physically. That's the impression he made on
me.' And then he barked out another word: 'A monster!'
A little shudder ran over him. 'I didn't see the face,' he went
on, 'because he didn't mean me to see it. He moved sideways,
the shoulder next to me humped up a trifle so as to
hide it. A bit of a beard I saw, or whiskers, straggly hair,
anyhow, that left in my mind some faint notion of pretence,
of a wig perhaps. But my mind at the moment was
on my business with Mrs Smith, and I wasn't trying to see
what a stranger pushing rudely past me was like. I had no
particular interest in him then. Clothes? … Oh, that I
couldn't say with accuracy either, but a dark suit, and a
bowler hat on his head. &lt;em&gt;Dark&lt;/em&gt;,' he emphasized, 'the whole
look and feel of the man was dark.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still anxiously waiting for that account of his waking
up frightened in his chair, for my interest was now
deeply held. But I was patient; I had to be. He went on to
tell me how he was for ever expecting to see the man again,
yet did not see him. This repetition, in the tale as he told it,
was not redundant, though, when written, it may seem so.
It led up with a bang, as it were, to the meeting — the sight,
rather — when it came. Every morning on going out to his
work he was positive he must pass the fellow on the darkish
stairs, but the stairs were empty; on the landing when he
opened his door, on the front-door steps when he returned
in the evening, but landing and steps were unoccupied. He
would have a good look at the door first from a little way
up the street, before coming to it, for the dread of meeting
was established, horribly established, in his being — 'expectant
dread,' he called it. Then, suddenly, he did see him.
This was the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I was hardly settled at my desk in the Reading Room,'
he described the incident, 'when I found I'd left my employer's
letter on the mantelpiece. It had questions for me
to verify, you see. I hurried back for it. It only took five
minutes — that's why the house suited me so — but I had a
good squint first from a distance to see if the doorstep was
free. No one was visible. I ran up. Just as I slipped my latchkey
in, I glanced up — something made me — and there he
was, staring down at me from the window.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'In your room!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I saw the face for the first time, but only for a second,
just long enough for our eyes to meet. He withdrew it
instantly — awfully quick, I mean. It was dark, unshaven,
the beard not a real intended beard. I saw hanging lips. No,
it was not what you'd call an evil face, not in that sense,
but it was dreadful in the sense of being out of relation
with any world I knew. Horrible, appalling, in that way. It
was a mad face. Behind its darkness there was white — the
white of terror. The face was all I really saw, with just a
bit of the neck that had a thin red scarf about it … The key
dropped out of my fingers with a clatter on the steps. I was
shaking all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ferreting about in my room! … was my first thought -
the room that used to be his! … But a second thought came
with it simultaneously, and it was this second thought that
unsettled me most, I believe. I realized in a flash that the
fellow had been actually watching me ever since my arrival,
keeping out of my way on purpose, waiting an opportunity,
waiting for me to go out — oh, I can't describe it exactly -
but he knew my every moment, I mean.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You rushed up —?' I interrupted. It was a stupid question,
but the dread of this mysterious lodger in my mind
excited me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson hesitated. 'I've got a vile temper, you know,' he
said, shyly rather, as though I was not supposed to be aware
of this, '&lt;em&gt;vile&lt;/em&gt;', he repeated with emphasis and a touch of
shame, 'curiously sudden too —'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'That brute in your own room,' I helped him. For a
moment I feared I was to hear of a violent assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I was up those stairs in a second or two,' he went on,
'and the first thing I noticed on getting to the top was that
my door was moving. There was no one on the landing. The
room itself was empty.' He paused, looking at me significantly.
'The fellow,' he then added, 'had got out — just in
time.' Again he paused for a moment. 'I shouldn't have
waited to ask any questions, you know.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew he meant it, but I was glad to have been spared
details of an ugly assault. This savage temper in Moleson
always alarmed me rather. I verily believe he would have
done the fellow in. His face, as he told it, betrayed him. By
this time, moreover, I already had a shrewd suspicion of what
Was to prove the explanation of this unpleasant and mysterious
lodger: a mad mind certainly, a maniac probably (I
had glimpses of a homicidal maniac), he would turn out to
be the son of Mrs Smith. That I was partly right, yet at the
same time curiously wrong, is a tribute perhaps to the
unconscious skill with which Moleson told his story, concealing
its climax admirably, yet disdaining to mislead me
by using false clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crime of murder, at any rate, was meanwhile spared
him. The room was empty, nothing had apparently been
touched, and the corridor was empty too. His suggestion of
having been 'watched' I disregarded. Later, however, I
inclined to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Across my landing,' Moleson continued, 'was one door
only — the door of what I felt convinced was his room. It
was closed. My first instinct was to bang at it and ask him
what the devil … Well,' — he laughed a little — 'I didn't do
it, that's all. My anger had cooled down somehow. I just
snatched up the letter I'd come to fetch and went back to
the Museum Reading Room.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at him, impressed by his admirable brevity, thinking
of the MC gained in Flanders, of that runaway he once
stopped, of the two hefty ruffians he fought, half killing one
of them, in a Surrey lane when they objected to his interfering
on behalf of their overloaded horses. He had various
things to his credit of this sort, and he was delicate, of slight
build, no muscles or brawn at all. Moleson, with his fierce,
perhaps great, spirit, was not negligible. Any story he told,
I mean, had value … 'Now,' I thought to myself, 'at last
we'll get to this business about waking up frightened!' Not
a bit of it. He must tell me something about Mrs Smith first.
And though it delayed the thing I wanted to hear, it was
worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor lodging-houses have secrets, secret lodgers, as well,
no doubt. His room was cheap, too cheap. But it was not his
business, after all. 'Better leave it at that!' he decided. Only
one thing troubled me about Mrs Smith — her interest,
namely, in ascertaining if he was 'not interfered with' — as
though she had rather expected that he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be disturbed.
Her phrase had anchored itself in his mind; he was always
recalling it; he couldn't forget it apparently. Why should he
be 'interfered with'? What — who — should interfere with
him? Who, indeed, he reflected, but this man? This man
who had been turned out for him? This man whose room
he now undoubtedly occupied? And so it was that, since
Mrs Smith came to no closer terms with the real question
she longed to ask, he now, for his part, decided to come to
closer terms with the question &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wanted to ask: 'Who is
your other lodger?' For the floor below being empty, he
knew, there was none but himself and this other lodger in
the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After various hints, suggestions and the rest, chances he
provided but she did not take, the expression in her face
invariably making him pause — after numerous futile leads,
he came abruptly one day to the direct question. Tired of
fencing, a touch of his queer anger stirred in him. He made
up his mind to know whether her feelings were upset or
not. He put the brutal question, though he did it delicately
enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'By the by,' he said, as they were in the narrow hall,
money having just passed, 'I meant to ask you sooner, Mrs
Smith — my typewriter at night — does it disturb anyone?
The gentleman opposite, I mean?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he was prepared for evasion of some kind, he was certainly
not prepared for the answer he received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'She denied there being any gentleman opposite at all?'
I asked, as Moleson hesitated, wondering, I fancied, how best
to make her answer sound credible to a Philistine like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'She &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; answer,' he said briefly. 'Her face turned white
as a sheet. She fell back against the hatrack. She screamed.
It was a curious scream, rather low, not noisy a bit. And it
was pain, not fear. She was hurt, terribly hurt. She began
to cry … '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further explanation of the amazing collapse, beyond
that her 'art caught me sudden — it's always been weak,' —
there was none. It was in this brief fashion that Moleson
related the incident, then left it there without another word
— as I too must therefore leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some days after that nothing happened. He did not see
the lodger. He avoided the landlady. He began to look forward
to the end of his stay, hurrying his work at the Museum
purposely. But his mind was for ever going back, he says, to
that odd question about being 'interfered with', and one
night in particular, as he sat over his Notes after dinner,
memory carried him away rather forcibly, rather persistently,
to that phrase which had inserted his original uneasiness.
He sat in his chair, lolling back, and thinking about it,
wondering afresh about this mysterious lodger, about what
he did, why he hid so carefully, why he watched him. The
old notions slipped through his mind, for no new ones
occurred to him: was he a coiner of counterfeit money, a
blackmailer, a lunatic, a man wanted by the police, a man
who ought by rights to be shut up, a suicidal maniac …
and so, eventually, he dropped asleep in his chair … to wake
up suddenly 'frightened, and in acute distress'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at last, we had got to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late. The night was very still, all noises in the street
had stopped. No footsteps even were audible on the pavement
through the open window. 'I woke up cold,' he said,
'cold to the bone. The room, in spite of the warm summer
air, was icy. I was shivering.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at first, rather bewildered after his sleep, he sat there
listening, waiting, wondering why he felt cold, wondering
for some minutes what the matter was. That something
was the matter, he felt sure. Something had been happening,
had just happened, while he was asleep. But what? He collected
his senses, remembering exactly where he was.
Details, of course, came back quickly then. He says the first
thing he noticed was that a change had come over the room.
The room was somehow different. It had curiously altered.
When he dropped off to sleep it had been one thing, now it
was another. He glanced about him, searching uncomfortably
for evidence of this change, but finding no single detail
altered, nothing out of place, the furniture exactly as it
always was — until his eye rested on the door. The door, he
phrased it, 'drew' his attention, although a closed door —
and it was closed now — must always, it seemed to me, look
much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Well,' he said, 'it didn't.' He used the tone of challenge,
anticipating disbelief. 'That door,' he declared, 'had been
opened and shut while I was asleep.' He waited a moment.
'It had only just been shut.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaginative statement struck me as singularly dramatic.
Proof, of course, was not possible, yet a door, I reflected,
is easily the most significant feature of a house, opened,
closed, tapped on, locked; it is a frontier, a threshold, and
when passed, either in exit or entrance, leads necessarily to
other conditions of living, to other states of mind, since it
leads to other people and other atmosphere. I could understand
in a fashion that Moleson used those words. He rather
convinced me, I mean, that he was possibly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'That's what made you wake,' I offered, filling the pause
he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Yes,' he returned flatly. 'While I slept, that door had
been opened, someone had looked in, come in, moved about
the room, done something, then gone out again — gone out
just that instant.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of this change in the room, or in the atmosphere
about him, he sat for some time staring at that door. He
listened intently. A glance at his wrist-watch showed that
it was two in the morning, so that he had slept several hours,
The deep silence of the house came over him unpleasantly,
and his distress, instead of passing, increased. He found himself
still shivering. But a moment later his cold skin turned
hot and broke out in a profuse perspiration — at a sound.
It was a sound he recognized, having heard it before: the
dragging of furniture or luggage across the landing, of heavy
and awkward articles, difficult to move. He had heard it
already several times, late at night, early in the morning,
through his dreams as well, and he had always ascribed it to
the lodger, busy arranging things in his room opposite, and
using the landing sometimes in so doing. He had paid no
particular attention to it, beyond a passing annoyance at
the choice of hours, and the sounds had usually ceased after
a few minutes at the most. Now, however, he was conscious
of a difference, for in the first place it was two in the morning,
when ordinary people were asleep; secondly, he realized
distinctly, it was not furniture or luggage being moved —
it was a piece of luggage, a heavy piece, for the sound was
unmistakable. He thought of a trunk or portmanteau. Moreover
— it was going on immediately outside his own door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The fellow was dragging this luggage of his across the
landing just beyond my door,' Moleson underlined the fact.
'At two o'clock in the morning, if you please!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first effect upon him was one of a queer paralysis,
mental and physical. He could neither think nor move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I just sat listening to the fellow dragging his great bag,
or whatever it was, across the landing — dragging it, I supposed,
towards his own room opposite. Then, very gradually,
my mental numbness lifted, and I found myself wondering
why. At two in the morning! Dragging luggage about!
What was he doing with luggage on the landing of a Bloomsbury
lodging-house at that unearthly hour? So close to my
own door too? The bumping and scraping were audible
enough; there was no pretence of doing it quietly. Where
was he taking his luggage from? Where to? My mind
worked quickly, once it started. A score of questions rushed
over me. What could it be, this bag, this portmanteau, this
heavy bundle so difficult to move? What could it contain?
What had he put inside it? Taken?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Taken? … ' I repeated, not quite following him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Some of the questions, racing through my mind,' he explained,
'brought a kind of answer with them. That's the
only way I can put it,' he added apologetically, a sop to me,
the sceptical recipient of his confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What had he taken?' he repeated, looking at me rather
hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'But I had,' said Moleson with decision, interpreting my
blank expression,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I guessed at once — half guessed, at least.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had me at a loss there, I admit; but I made no comment,
merely nodding my head affirmatively. His next
words took me completely by surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'His great bag or bundle, whatever it was,' whispered
Moleson, 'contained something he had just taken out of my
room, While I slept, the fellow had sneaked in, crept about,
found what he wanted, taken it, and sneaked out again with
it — in his bag.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I made no comment, the explanation being too
preposterous to argue about. Moleson, besides, was now too
earnest and convinced — he knew, remember, the climax,
whereas I was still in ignorance — too eager to make his full
confession for me to interfere and cavil with commonplace
criticism. It might have stopped him, for one thing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You missed anything?' I asked, no disbelief in my face
or voice. I had to repeat it before he replied, and his reply,
when it came, again took me by surprise. Also, it sent a
shiver through me, as though the hair were moving on my
scalp:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What he had taken,' he told me in a lowered voice, and
speaking very slowly, 'was not in my room at that time —
when I fell asleep, I mean. But it had been there — some
time before.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement, naturally, left me without a rejoinder. I
lit a cigarette and waited in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'At that moment,' he said impressively, still in his whisper,
and loathing coming into his face with a leap, as it were, 'I
knew — he was a — horror. Oh, in every meaning of the
word. And a queer, sudden revulsion rushed over me — the
intense desire to see him close, to look at him face to face,
to speak to him — I never once heard his voice, you know
— to — yes, even to touch the brute; and in so doing — somehow
— God knows how — to get rid of him. So far he had
avoided me deliberately. All this time he had evaded,
escaped me. He &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to avoid and escape me, but now at
last I had him close — a few feet away — busy, occupied,
within reach, unable to get away — if I just opened that door,
I need only open that door, and I should see him — catch him
in the act.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longing to ask 'In what act?' I ventured instead: 'You felt
angry all of a sudden?' and hit the mark better than I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admitted it, ashamed a little, with a nod. 'I felt cold
all over, mind you,' he went on, always in that low voice,
'scared as well, really scared, but at the same time, as you
say, I felt' — he chose a queer word — 'vicious. Exasperated,
too, a bit. I wanted to be done with it. I wanted to get at the
fellow. Why the devil should he make this infernal row at
two in the morning? How dared he? How dared he come
into another man's room, even if it had once been his own?
Why should he watch me, bother me, haunt me, get into
my mind — and all the rest of it? Yes,' — with a touch of
fierceness — 'you're right — I did feel angry all of a sudden. I
decided abruptly I'd go out —'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Open that door?' — I simply couldn't keep it back. Personally,
I should not have opened that door at two in the
morning under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Yes, open the door, go out, and tell the brute to go to
hell. I decided to do that — and more —'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew what that 'more' meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'— but when I tried to get up from my chair, I found I
couldn't move. I just sat there, furious angry, struggling —
like a mechanical doll whose machinery had run down. I
was dying to get at the fellow. I was perspiring all over. I
felt that if he answered back, showed any insolence, I'd —
strangle him — just go for him and be done with it. Throttle
the devil! I felt my fingers at his throat, the prickle of his
filthy beard, saw his hanging lips drop wider as he fought
for breath, his beastly eyes bulge out, his face turn black —
oh, I was in this odd, sudden fury, I admit — and yet — I
couldn't move an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Perhaps — probably — I made a noise of some kind -
cursed aloud most likely, but anyhow the sound of the
dragging luggage suddenly stopped. A deep, rather an extraordinary,
silence followed. I could hear the blood beating
in my head. I sat fixed in my chair like a dummy, staring at
the door. Only that door separated us. He existed there —
breathing, vivid, intense — a few feet from where I sat rigid
in my chair, unable to get at him, unable to move a muscle.
He seemed to exert some tremendous pressure on me,
paralysing my will, holding me helpless where I was.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson mopped his forehead a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I was so angry,' he went on, rather breathless now in his
excitement, as though he lived over again his fury and exasperation,
'that I felt murder in me. Positively, I felt myself
a murderer.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, he stopped dead suddenly. A look of shyness
came over him. He stared at me, I stared back at him. Such
language, of course, in anybody else, would have been
merely extravagant, hysterical. In his case it was real. I
knew his sudden, ungovernable temper; I knew, too, he was
ashamed of it. In a less civilized country he must always
have been in trouble with his gun. He was the type that saw
red and killed. And a quick flash of understanding somehow
came into me, so that I guessed in that instant the explanation
both of his abrupt pause and of his queer shyness. Having
this dangerous thing in himself, he recognized it in others
too. That sympathy existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'That's how I knew,' he muttered, looking down, having
guessed my thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was?' I asked, fumbling With my cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A murderer,' he said quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited in silence, wondering what he was going to tell
me. His face was rather white, his excitement only kept
under by his doubt of being believed. It was best now, I
felt, to ask no questions. In his own way he would presently
go on. But curiosity, I confess, devoured me. Did he open
that door? Did he see the other fellow, speak to him, touch
him, perhaps go for him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His own mind, however, was an odd psychological revelation
— of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'And the instant I realized &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;,' he went on, 'the power
to move came back to me. My muscles acted. The pressure
the fellow exerted was lifted, because we understood one
another. There was that ghastly sympathy between us. I
got out of my chair and crossed the floor. I reached the
door. Then I stopped a moment and listened. He, too, I
knew, was listening a few inches away from my face,
nothing but half an inch of thin boards between us, listening
to my movements, bending to the keyhole probably, crouching,
his luggage neglected for a moment while he waited to
see what I was going to do. A second later I caught the
handle, turned it, and flung the door wide open with a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There he was before me. Quite close. He was bending
down, exactly as I had imagined, crouching, his head
lowered; and at his feet, less than a yard beyond me, I saw
on the floor the dark blotch that was his luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What happened then happened so quickly that it seemed
less than a second. From the stooping position he did not
rise, nor make any attempt to rise. One hand, still stretched
out upon the bag, began to work. He pulled at it. He had
been pulling at it when I opened the door, and he went on
pulling at it — dragging it, dragging it away from me, away
from the door, and across the landing floor. I, for my part,
had one hand raised to strike, to clutch, to kill if necessary,
but my hand did not fall, I did nothing violent, because I
made in that very instant a horrible discovery. I suddenly
realized that he did not see me. He had not noticed me. He
was not aware of my being there close beside him. He did
not react to my presence in any way, because he was simply
not conscious of it. He continued doing what he had been
doing just before — dragging his luggage across the landing
floor. I saw the dark mass of it go hitching along in jerks as
he pulled. It was very heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'And this — this not being aware of me, I mean — came
as a tremendous shock. The surprise of it, perhaps. It was
the last thing in the world I'd expected. I had rather looked
for something sudden, violent. I was prepared for it. This
way he just ignored me turned me cold. It struck me as
unnatural. I stood and stared, for I didn't know what else
to do, and my body was trembling, and I felt queerly uncertain
of my legs. I watched him go on dragging at that heavy
thing, which I now saw was not luggage after all, not ordinary
luggage, at least. It was neither bag nor portmanteau,
nor anything like that. It was a sack of awkward shape and
outline, It was unpleasant, I thought, the way it bulged. But
more than that, more than unusual, it gave me a turn — I
felt it somewhere awful. And realizing this, I made an
unconscious movement evidently, for I felt my breath catch,
and { must have staggered a little. I caught at the edge of
the door to steady myself, and the door, naturally, yielded
with my weight; I lurched with it, sideways at first, then a
little outwards as the door came with me, and then — forwards.
Before I could recover balance, I was against him. I
was right into him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'But I didn't fall. I didn't, thank God, collide with the
monstrous creature and his awful sack, but I was so close
against him that the shock of finding nothing solid — there
was no substance there at all — stopped my heart for a
second. It seemed to rush up into my throat. Then my breath
came back, and I let out a yell into the night that must have
been heard in the street. At which moment, still dragging at
his bundle, he made a sudden, rather violent, movement. He
turned in a new way. I saw his face clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'By &amp;quot;clearly&amp;quot; I mean close — dreadfully close. It was
turned up, but I saw it obliquely rather, a kind of sideways
glimpse, and even then he wasn't looking at me. The light
from the open door behind fell on it, and I saw the eyes,
blazing eyes, the hanging lips, the white skin smudged with
unshaven hair of the growing black beard, and — to my
utter amazement — tears upon the cheeks. It was a maniac's
face, if ever I saw one. The other thing that I saw clearly
was that the thin red scarf about the neck was not a scarf
at all. It was a thin red line of contused blood in the flesh of
the neck itself, a line that only a rope, drawn very tightly,
could have made.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson stopped then and sank back in his chair, looking
away from me, and glad, I think, that he had got so far
without interruption. His words and manner, his facial expression
above all, conveyed his horror far better than his
jerked-out sentences, I smoked a moment in silence, handing
him a cigarette too, which he refused. But he said nothing
for some little time, while I also kept back a dozen questions
that rushed up in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What happened then?' I ventured at length. 'What did
you do?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Nothing,' he replied briefly, looking up at me again, his
manner now quiet and collected. 'I did nothing. It seemed,
somehow, there was nothing I wanted to do. A feeling I
must shout, strike out, do something violent passed. What
was done next, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; did. I merely looked on and watched.
There was no emotion in me of any sort. I was just numb.
My whole consciousness, I think, was in my eyes.'I stared
… as he went on dragging that heavy mass across the landing,
always a little farther from me, hitching and shoving it
along with great effort — towards the door of his room. Then
he opened the door, but the light from my room did not
reach to it, and as it was not lit inside, I saw nothing but a
black space. I watched. I saw everything he did, every movement
he made. He stepped to one side, across the bundle, so
that he was then pushing instead of dragging. His whole body
was bent double with the effort to get the thing through the
door and inside the room. Apparently it was difficult to do.
He accomplished it after several minutes. He closed the
door, putting his weight against it heavily from outside, and
then — after that — well — he wasn't there any more.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He'd gone into the room?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson shrugged his shoulders. 'Can't say,' he answered
rather curtly. 'I tell you he simply wasn't there. I couldn't
see him any more. I'd lost sight of him.' He added sheepishly:
'Something happened to my eyes, I suppose. I didn't
see him go — but he was gone.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully five minutes passed, Moleson then told me slowly,
before he could think, much less move. He was struck dumb
with terror and amazement. He felt stupid, empty of life,
unable to act at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It may have been five minutes,' he said, 'but it may just
as well have been twenty — for all I know. The only thing
I remember clearly is that my awful yell — that wild shriek I
let out into the night some time before — still seemed to me
echoing through the house and down the stairs. I had a feeling
it must have been heard in the street and the police
would be in. But nothing happened. The fellow's disappearance
bewildered me to a point I can't describe properly. I
&lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; I hadn't been dreaming, but I knew damned little else,
it seems to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I moved at last, after a bit. I moved backwards. I threw
my own door as wide as it would go, so as to get all the
light there was, and the light streamed across the landing
and fell on the door — his door. I knew I was going to open
that door. I had to.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His pluck hardly surprised me, for I already knew it. I
admired it. Nothing in this world or the next could have
induced me to go near that door, much less open it. Moleson,
however, did more: he went over and knocked loudly
against its boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The sound echoed,' he told me, 'but not inside. It echoed
down the stairs, I mean. The boards sounded dull. That dullness
explained itself,' he added, with a quick glance up at
me as though, of course, I understood what he meant. But I
did not understand, and my eyebrows went up in query and
response. 'lt wasn't an ordinary door,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You — opened it?' I had no inkling what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I guessed it wasn't a proper door,' he replied, changing
his adjective, but leaving me more ignorant than before.
'I'd felt that some time before.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Sham? … '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Not an ordinary door into an ordinary room,' he explained,
with a hint of impatience at my stupidity. 'When I
knocked,' he went on, 'and got no answer, I knew I was
right. The dead sound proved it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Oh! … '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Yes,' he went on quietly, 'the dead muffled sound it made.
I waited a moment. Then I opened it. It was the door of a
cupboard — a rather shallow cupboard.' He paused, then
said something that made my blood curdle: 'That's why the
creature had to shove it in so hard — &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; it in — to make it
stay —'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Upright? … ' I gasped, catching the ghastly meaning at
last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Upright,' was all he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dusk was now fallen into our room between us, and I
saw the glow of my cigarette-end in the mirror, behind his
chair. It had been a dreadful story. I longed for light and a
glass of whisky. Moleson had so convinced me of the truth,
the reality, of his confession, yet I got the feeling that he
hoped I would tear it to pieces and demolish it utterly, proving
to his satisfaction how absurd it all was, and using nice
words like hallucination, overwrought nerves, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I remained rather quiet and non-committal, and
certainly dumb; I could not honestly comfort him in the
way he wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I told you,' he resumed, his voice much lower now, 'that
I imagined that shriek of mine still echoing in the house and
down the stairs? Well, a few moments later, while I still
stood glaring at that ghastly cupboard, all black and empty
… I heard a sound on the stairs. It was below me, coming
nearer, I couldn't move — not an inch, one way or the other.
I was just stuck to the floor. But I felt sure of one thing —
it wasn't — but he couldn't say the word he meant, the word
in his mind — 'it wasn't' — He stuck again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; was it?' I asked quickly, eager to help him, but to
help myself at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I saw the light first,' he said, 'the light of a candle, evidently,
flickering on the wall, then on the ceiling. Next
came the shadow, enormously magnified and grotesque.
Then came a large white face of melancholy and terror
mixed, looming at me over the banisters. There was a thin
voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&amp;quot; … interfered with … &amp;quot; I heard from what seemed an
immense distance. … &amp;quot;He showed hisself, then, did he?
… May God forgive me …&amp;quot; and something about a &amp;quot;broken
promise&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;room I didn't oughter 'ave let to anyone
… &amp;quot; And then, as, to my shame, I felt myself being
helped up from the floor — for I had no idea I had let my
legs give way like that — something — oh, horrible and dreadful
— about &amp;quot; … they 'anged him for it; oh, they 'anged him
at the Scrubs … it was 'is own father, you see … and now
over twenty years ago … &amp;quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were gulping sounds, he remembers, and these odd,
broken words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moleson, curiously enough, had never gone to the trouble
to verify anything, and it was my vile curiosity that had to
find its own satisfaction. The British Museum, where he had
worked so hard, gave me certain facts in the newspapers of
long before the war. The 'Warley Parricide', I discovered,
and the unpleasant details about how the body was found
stuffed into a cupboard, and how the public signed a petition
and the lawyers urged homicidal mania, but without the
intended result. The Home Secretary, one paper dared to
mention, had married again and had stepsons of his own …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. T. Smith, the prominent stockbroker
of Capel Court in the City of London, woke that
morning, the sun was streaming into his comfortable
bedroom in a respectable quarter of the
region north of Hyde Park. He felt a curious
sense of exhilaration, a strange glow of happiness. Like a boy
who knows he has done well in an examination, he experienced
a delightful, light-hearted anticipation. And this glow pervaded
his whole being. It was as if he expected some happy event,
a piece of luck, a glorious stroke of chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not define it, but he felt that it was there, almost
within his grasp. So vivid was this happy emotion that he
sprang from the bed and stood in his striped blue and white
pyjamas, staring out of the open window. The sun on his bare
neck was hot, birds were singing in the mangy cedar of the
small garden, a few early hyacinths blazed just below him in a
narrow strip of green. But he saw nothing to account for what
he felt. The sparrows were dirtier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was puzzled. Tightening the belt of his pyjamas which
had become loose in sleep, he smoothed his scanty hair and
rubbed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Had a dream, I suppose,&amp;quot; he mumbled to himself. &amp;quot;A
jolly dream sometimes does the trick,&amp;quot; he added, opening his
jacket wider to let the sun warm his scraggy chest. Only, he
could not remember any dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. T. Smith liked things explained properly, and this
bright happiness lay beyond his explanation. It had nothing
to do with his business, nothing to do with the buying and selling
of shares. He knew that instinctively. His business was
good, but it was not as good as that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stroked his bare chest and smiled. Something important
was going to happen to him. He felt it in his bones. It was
something that might alter his whole life. But of what
kind, he asked himself, opening another button, and staring
fixedly at the milkman in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So methodical was Mr. T. Smith, so regular in his life, that
this stir of emotion upset him rather. His business, inherited
from an uncle, was steady and lucrative. &amp;quot;Mr. T. Smith and
Co.&amp;quot; was respected in the City. It was a family business, his
clients too respectable to allow of mistakes. They lived and
died prepared — by Mr. T. Smith and Co. Irregularities played
no role. His quarters in North London were also eminently
right. His landlady, Miss Slumbubble, had looked after him
for twenty years. She even mended his clothes; added new
pockets when his money, wearing holes, slipped through. The
first time, he remembered, the new pocket was too deep, so
that his hand dipped to his knee to find a coin. But that was
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Withdrawing from the open window, where the milkman
watched him with too much interest, he thought, Mr. T. Smith
dressed and went down to breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You 'ad a good night?&amp;quot; asked Miss Slumbubble as usual,
bringing the invariable eggs and bacon. &amp;quot;You slep' well, Mr.
Smith?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Better than ever, thank you, Miss Slumbubble,&amp;quot; he replied,
also as usual. He wondered if she noticed the excitement that
still burned in him like a flame. He hoped not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently she did not. &amp;quot;That mattress,&amp;quot; she observed,
&amp;quot;is the best in London. And I always make your bed myself,
Mr. Smith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had said this every morning for the past twenty years,
and Mr. T. Smith knew exactly the reply she expected. &amp;quot;I
thought you had.&amp;quot; He produced it with a smile, and began to
eat his eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Miss Slumbubble could not know with what curious
excitement he had sprung from the &amp;quot;best mattress in London&amp;quot;
an hour ago, nor with what a strange sense of anticipatory
happiness he started forth upon his day. He put his impeccable
tie, if possible, straighter, he tugged at his moustache, he took
his umbrella, he set forth. &amp;quot;I feel a bit of a dog, you know,
this morning,&amp;quot; he caught himself saying under his breath —
then turned sharply, for Miss Slumbubble stood behind him.
She invariably saw him off to the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah! Good-bye, Miss Slumbubble,&amp;quot; he exclaimed as usual.
&amp;quot;I shall be back by seven o'clock.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And your dinner will be ready for you, Mr. Smith,&amp;quot; replied
the landlady, also as usual. &amp;quot;And I 'ope it won't rain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith paused before making his customary comment.
As a rule he said &amp;quot;I trust not,&amp;quot; but this morning the words
refused to come as they had always come before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; — to-day,&amp;quot; he heard himself saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the door slammed behind him as he said it. He heard
the bang. He was not sure whether Miss Slumbubble had
caught his words or not. He laughed to himself. He pulled
at his moustache. Usually, it felt soft, but now, he noticed, it
felt stiff and wiry. It bristled, rather. He laughed again and
set forth briskly to walk across the Park to his office. He had,
after all, forgotten his umbrella. &amp;quot;Something's wrong with
me,&amp;quot; he chuckled to himself, &amp;quot;or — perhaps — it's something
right.&amp;quot; He laughed outright. &amp;quot;Anyhow, it's — &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as he strode along, he suddenly recalled that Miss
Slumbubble had made an unusual remark to him. His mind,
occupied with something else at the moment, had not noticed
it. Now it came back to him. When he said it could not
rain to-day, her comment was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, she would have said that &amp;quot;she oped not.&amp;quot; This
morning she said another thing: &amp;quot;Anything may 'appen,&amp;quot;
were the words she used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything,&amp;quot; agreed Mr. T. Smith, laughing so happily
that, as he crossed Bayswater Road into the Park, he nearly
got run over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ii"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the routine of years, he strolled across the Park,
intending to take a 'bus eventually at Trafalgar Square. But
to-day he felt a strange reluctance to go to his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fought against this, for what would people say if Mr.
T. Smith was late? He had never been late. His reputation
was based upon his punctuality. His clients would talk. Even
Miss Slumbubble might hear of it. It would never do if he
dawdled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bother Miss Slumbubble!&amp;quot; he suddenly exclaimed.
&amp;quot;And hang my clients! What does it matter if I am late!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the way something was singing in his heart. Perhaps
it was that the spring was running in his blood. For now, at
last, the spring had really come. Late in May the sun had finally
struggled out, and the endless winter seemed to be gone for
good. He saw a swallow darting past a chimney. A whiff of
warm, scented air blew over him. He thought of gorse and
pine trees on some sandy waste … of lizards …
butterflies. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew suddenly that it was something more than the
spring. His whole being thrilled to a new rhythm. Someone —
somewhere — had piped and he had heard. The real
man had answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court, but the other one —
Tornado Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he now abruptly remembered that he was named
Tornado. Mr. T. Smith, most people thought, was Thomas
Smith, even Timothy Smith, but actually his first name was
Tornado. And surely he was not called Tornado for nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the half-named Tornado that heard the queer piping
and answered to it, the part of him that, against all judgment
and reason, drove his little sailing boat out of the safety of the
harbour into the wintry gales of his brief holidays — Tornado,
the adventurer that underlay the man of business, the part
of him that took wild, even ridiculous, risks from time to time.
It was just this &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; belonging to &amp;quot;Tornado,&amp;quot; that
made him different from the jostling thousands he passed daily
on his trudge to his office in the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some spring, some bubble, danced now in his heart, discovered first,
it seemed, in sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His steps, unconsciously, became slower and slower. He
found himself regretting that he could name no valid excuse
for not turning up at the office. At every opportunity he paused
and looked about him. He studied the shop windows with the
closest attention, as if he had never seen them before — anything
to prolong his walk. He was waiting for something. But what
that &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; was he had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Tornado&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he repeated to himself with a new feeling of
its significance. As though his father had been a whirlwind,
his mother a storm. It made him laugh, as he dawdled on,
staring at this and that, idling, drifting, waiting …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was not till he had reached Trafalgar Square that
he came definitely to a halt. The office seemed suddenly more
than he could bear. He stopped dead. Something plucked
at his heart. He watched the pigeons drinking at the fountains.
He was very late already. He knew quite well that his secretary,
with a bundle of tiresome letters, was fuming and fussing; clients
were wondering why Mr. T. Smith was late. The telephone
was ringing … ringing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, let it ring!&amp;quot; he thought to himself. &amp;quot;And let the
secretary wait! And let the clients wonder why I'm late!
It'll do them all good!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lingered in the warm sunshine, watching the pigeons
preen themselves after their bath, or carrying on the love affairs
that the sudden spell of fine weather provoked. The London
sparrows, even the flies, detained him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He caught himself wondering why he still lived in London.
He had already made a good deal of money, enough to retire on.
Why did he still waste what remained of his early manhood in
this hateful way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were there not other lands that he could visit, lands with
blue skies and sparkling seas? Countries free from the bugbear
of what men called &amp;quot;progress,&amp;quot; more primitive, perhaps, yet
at the same time more peaceful? Places where people still
sang at their work in the hot sunshine … ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought of all he had read about the lotus-lands of the
East and of scattered isles in the Pacific, of coral reefs and
golden strands. It was difficult to believe all the stories he
had read about such places, though he remembered the strange
chill the reading had given him at the time. There ought to
be, there must be, he felt, countries just like that, countries
where things happened, countries where the inhabitants did
more than merely catch 'buses and run for electric trains. He
recalled the sunny, golden advertisements he had read, the
travel-folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he tried in his mind to decide if there was any place
that absolutely fulfilled his requirements. He felt a little
doubtful. Nothing short of a real fairyland would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time he stood thus, gazing into the shimmering
fountain, but he no longer saw the water where the dirty pigeons
bathed. He saw the long line of a coral reef with the great
combers breaking over it in silvery foam against a background
of waving coconut palms on some enchanted island of the
Southern Seas. Soft winds brushed his cheeks. He heard the
sea-birds cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimly he became aware that a small boy was standing
beside him, gazing up into his face with large dark eyes. It was
these enquiring eyes that first arrested his attention, for they
shared, it seemed, his own vision, and saw what he saw. They
were looking, surely, at something the others did not see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the boy, at the first glance, seemed commonplace
enough — like hundreds of others one saw pouring out of school
in a back street. Poorly clad, with a thin, half-starved body,
there was nothing about him the least attractive. On the
second glance, however, Tornado saw that there was a difference.
His features were finer than those of the average slum child.
In spite of his poor clothes, he carried himself with a certain
air, a kind of unconscious grace that suggested some wild animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court found himself staring at him —
as a dog or other wild creature stares — full of interest, curiosity,
wonder, all of them spontaneous and unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Buy a ticket, sir,&amp;quot; said the boy in a pleasant, piping
voice. &amp;quot;They're only a shilling.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But where can I go — in these days — for a shilling?&amp;quot;
Tornado asked, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All the way,&amp;quot; the boy answered gravely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;All the way&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; echoed Tornado doubtfully, his heart
beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw that the boy actually held pieces of blue paper in
his hand that looked like tickets. The sight troubled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; he stammered, &amp;quot;of course, I will.&amp;quot; He tried
to look as if he were amused, while actually a lump rose somewhere
in his throat, as he handed the boy a shilling and took
the blue strip of paper in exchange. His hand was shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little fellow turned to go, then stopped suddenly and
came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful never to lose it, Tornado,&amp;quot; he said shyly. &amp;quot;Full
directions are written on the back.&amp;quot; And he turned away a
second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But — how do you know my name?&amp;quot; enquired Tornado,
trembling now all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange boy smiled up into his face. It was an entrancing
smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, we know our customers,&amp;quot; he said softly. &amp;quot;They are
so few.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don't sell many then?&amp;quot; began Tornado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the boy was really gone. It almost seemed as
if he had vanished. He melted away so quickly into the passing
throng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado looked at the blue slip of paper in his hand. On
the back, sure enough, were some lines of writing. The thin,
spidery letters were queer looking, and, instead of ink, some
silvery liquid had been used. But the directions, once he
mastered the script, were plain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Be at the Robin Hood Gate at Richmond Park before noon,&amp;quot;
he read, &amp;quot;and there you will see a girl knitting beneath an
oak tree with a cat beside her. Show her this paper and she
will put you on your way.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="iii"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time Tornado turned the paper over and over in
his hand. Of course, it was all nonsense. It was some charity
stunt, some treasure hunt organised to get money for a hospital.
It was one of these modern tricks that extort money out of the
sentimental crowd … And yet the whole thing fell in
so well with his idle mood that it provided just the excuse he
needed — not to go to his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will go,&amp;quot; he informed himself, rather like a truant boy,
&amp;quot;for the park will be lovely, and there may be somebody there!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back afterwards, Tornado often thought that the
strangest thing about this strange business was that, the moment
he decided to go, no further thought of his neglected work, of
his office, or even of his old life, ever crossed his mind. It was
as if his normal life had ended suddenly. He seemed to have
begun a new existence, while yet this &amp;quot;new existence&amp;quot; seemed
always to have been &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. It had always been within reach,
only he had never found the way. The old shackles and ties
were now cut through, at any rate, and a new and thrilling
sense of freedom swept over him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had found liberty at last! He felt like a gipsy who
leaves the old familiar camp behind him, knowing that the
entire world is his to roam as he will. His office, his rooms,
Miss Slumbubble, were wiped out as though they never had
existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How he reached Richmond Park he never quite knew. No
memory remains. Whether it was by 'bus or taxi, on foot,
or otherwise, he could not say. It seemed to him sufficient that
he found himself at the Robin Hood Gate in an incredibly short
time. He was simply — there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked about him eagerly, but at first could see no one
that answered in any way to the description on his ticket. The
sun blazed down from a cloudless sky; the trees and grasses
still held the freshness of early spring; the scent of the good
clean earth was in his nostrils. And he drew in deep breaths
of sheer delight at getting away so easily from the noise and
smell of the city. The day was radiant, sparkling. His blood
stirred within him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A park keeper, he noticed, was chatting idly with a nurse
girl, and an occasional car swept along the roadway with a swirl
of dust, yet without a sound. They were like pictures only.
But nowhere could he discover a girl beneath an oak tree with
a cat beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out the blue
ticket, intending to read it over once again, but, even as his
hand closed on it, he became aware that he was looking straight
at the object of his search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There sat a girl beneath an oak tree, exactly as described,
and a black cat was licking its paws beside her. He gazed.
A moment before the spot was empty. Yet no surprise stirred
in him. This, somehow, was just what he expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was excited, but not troubled. A flicker of nerves,
however, it seems, ran through him, for he dropped his ticket,
and as it fluttered down and he stooped hurriedly to recover
it, the girl and cat both vanished too. He could not be quite
sure, perhaps, being too intent on picking it up again. Yet
it was nowhere to be seen. Only a large green leaf lay at his
feet. He grabbed it instantly — and, sure enough, he again held
the ticket in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, he must have been mistaken about the disappearance
of the girl and cat. There they both were in front of him,
as plain as life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He advanced. The girl watched him coming. She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm glad you found your ticket,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I was
afraid you might have lost it altogether — like the others.&amp;quot;
Her voice was soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do most people lose it?&amp;quot; he found himself asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most, yes,&amp;quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And can you really show me the way?&amp;quot; he went on,
after a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl seemed amused at the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course I can,&amp;quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something within him hesitated and was afraid. He was
afraid of the question he wanted to ask, afraid that the reply
would never satisfy him. He took a gulp of breath. Then he
asked his question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is it to — Fairyland?&amp;quot; came his whisper. Is that
what the ticket means — all the way to Fairyland?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I live there,&amp;quot; replied the girl simply, &amp;quot;and my name is
Chance. My sister, Luck, lives with me,&amp;quot; she added, pointing
to the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But how can a cat be your sister?&amp;quot; Tornado asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl, without answering, looked at the cat, and Tornado,
following her glance, met the full glare of the cat's eyes. He
felt a faint shiver run through him. No further answer seemed
necessary. The eyes that met his own were not the eyes of a
cat, nor of a human being. They were the eyes, he realised
of a spirit — the eyes of something — of someone — who had seen
the birth and death of worlds, yet still lived on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feeling of chill swept over him. Questions that sprang
to his lips died in his throat and remained unuttered. His
breath failed him for some seconds. He stared from one to the
other uncertainly, and for several minutes no one spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an effort, Tornado looked towards the park gates.
To his surprise some subtle change was already at work. The
gates became dim, the nurse girl and the keeper appeared less
distinct. He gazed hard, trying to focus his sight, but a tenuous
veil seemed to have fallen between him and the familiar world
he knew of old. No effort he made could pierce it quite. This
queer soft gauze fell between his sight and what he had always
known as Reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned again to the girl. Change seemed to be at work
in her too. She looked less homely somehow. Her hair, which
he had before described to himself as a washed-out blond, had
deepened in colour; her rather faded blue eyes had lightened
up. It was as if some hidden lamp shone through. She began
to glow, to radiate light. Second by second her beauty increased.
A kind of radiance seemed to surround her like a cloud, and
this light glimmered everywhere through the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado next became aware that in some strange way
he, too, was changing. Slight tremors ran through him from
his head to his feet. He felt that he was altering, adapting
himself in some way to a changed condition of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in him, he felt, was being speeded up in marvellous
fashion, quickened, heightened, swept into higher,
swifter gears. His thoughts now tore through him at intenser
speed. Rapidity was the keynote. Soon, at this pace, he would
pass beyond the need of ordinary thought at all, of thought as
men knew it. A new power was invading him. Already he
seemed beyond the need of speech with his companions. Words,
syllables, were unnecessary, for in some strange way they
answered his unuttered questions. The blood raced through
his veins with a power that seemed strong enough to rend his
body in pieces. The tear and rush were furious. Yet he remained
utterly indifferent. In this new state the loss of his ordinary
bodily sensations, perhaps even of his body too, appeared a
matter too trivial to notice. There were more interesting things
to think of than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the familiar landmarks were already gone. The park
gates, the keeper and the keeper's lodge had long since vanished,
and only the tops of the biggest trees remained above a kind of
whitish mist. Even while he looked these, too, disappeared
with a kind of spiral swirl. The familiar world had faded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found himself upon a sandy path running through long
heather to a lonely sand beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun shone brightly on the sparkling water, and far
away he could just make out the dim shape of an island. Gulls
wheeled about the shore, and a heron, on lazy wing, passed
circling over his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked round for his companions. The cat had gone,
and in its place stood a dark and lovely girl. Her sister, the
fair one, stood beside her, smiling gravely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may call us Chance and Luck,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;for thus
are we known among men. But these are only names. Others
call us Fate and Destiny, though these, too, are wrong. In
reality there is only the Deed and the Payment.&amp;quot; She paused
and gazed into his eyes. &amp;quot;Perhaps, this is too hard for you,&amp;quot;
she went on gently, &amp;quot;but, if so, Merlin will explain, for he is the
wisest of those who dwell in Fairyland.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="iv"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado was in no mood to quibble about names, or as to
what Chance meant by her talk of Merlin. He felt a new life
pulsing through his veins, and his heart sang with happiness.
He noted, almost without astonishment, that he had shed his
old clothes somewhere on the journey, his usual City clothes.
Now he stood clad only in a leather jerkin with bare and sunburnt
legs, and instead of shoes he wore rough sandals of deer's hide.
A long hunting knife swung at his belt. Only one thing was
missing, a familiar thing that ought to have been there too.
What it was he could not say. He recognised its absence —
no more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted these changes without surprise, but at the
same time there came a fugitive flash of memory — a memory
of a dream, perhaps, that had come to him only last night.
Dreams have this way of cropping up in stray fragments
sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Miss — er — Slum —&amp;quot; he could not get the whole name,
&amp;quot;and that place of torture I was going to in my dreams — a
bell ringing, ringing — letter — lots of letters — Mr. T. Smith — .&amp;quot;
He passed his hand across his eyes in a vague effort to remember —
&amp;quot;dear, dear, what a horrid dream it was — and there's something
I've forgotten — I wonder if — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes caught the figures of the two girls running past
him, and all memory of his dream slipped from his consciousness
in the way dreams always slip away and are forgotten. His
years had fallen from him like the leaves of a tree, and the vigour
of youth was in his blood. Adventure was calling to him with
her deathless voice. Laughing, he ran down the path to join
his two companions on the edge of the water. He saw their
gleaming white legs as they stepped into a small sailing-boat
lying in the cover, its bow resting on the yellow sand, its stern
just afloat. As he reached them they paused and looked at
him. They leaped back to join him, sitting down on the sand
and motioning to him to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado sat down beside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's the boat that will take you to Fairyland,&amp;quot; said
Chance, smiling at him mischievously. &amp;quot;Have you the courage
to go in her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think so,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;What are the dangers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sisters whispered together for a moment. It was
Luck who answered him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is the danger of never getting back,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;of
never returning. It takes courage, too, to cross the Dragon
Field to get to your home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My home!&amp;quot; he exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at him encouragingly, they laughed, and their
laughter, he thought, was like the music of bells coming faintly,
sweetly across summer meadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your home, yes,&amp;quot; explained Chance. &amp;quot;Hasn't your home
always been here? Haven't you yourself made it here? Through
all the dull years, haven't you dreamed of a little house on the
edge of the forest, near a pool where the deer come down to
drink at nightfall? And a glade where the stags roar when the
autumn leaves are falling? And a sailing boat that will take
you far away to some enchanted isle? And a girl, perhaps,
with dark hair or with blond, and smiling eyes and happy
laughter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew it was all too true. For years and years, all
through his life, he had dreamed such things. From boyhood
he had dreamed of fords where knights-errant held the crossings
against all comers. Sometimes in his dreams he had seen a
battlemented town gay with flags, with strange old-world houses
and narrow, twisting streets. Time after time he had seen the
same town, so that in the end it had become as familiar to him
as his own small bit of London. He could find his way about it
quite well. He knew where the armourer had his shop and where
the leather-workers lived. Even the faces of the people who
kept the market stalls in the quaint little square by the church
were all familiar. Yet he was never quite sure of his own standing
in the town. Even in his dreams he was a little puzzled. Some
of the people saw and recognised him, but others completely
ignored him as though he was not there. All the same, he felt
that it was his own town in a sense. He knew it all, from the
archery butts to the tilting ground, where brave tournaments
were held with the splintering of lances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at his two companions. He saw that they read
his thoughts, and that there was no need of explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me, please, about the Dragon Field,&amp;quot; he said, a queer
trembling shyness in him. &amp;quot;Are they dangerous?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are terrifying,&amp;quot; said Luck. &amp;quot;You see, they are the
Guardians, and they don't let everybody by. They will not
touch you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whom do they stop?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck reflected a moment. &amp;quot;Oh, quite a lot of people,&amp;quot;
she replied presently. &amp;quot;Those who are cruel to animals and
children chiefly. Then money-grubbers and gluttons, the kind
that are always thinking of their comfort and their clothes and
their looks. Fat people, too, with shiny skins. You know the sort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado sighed. &amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; he agreed, &amp;quot;it would never
do to let them in. They would make the place impossible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And people who never, never take any sort of risk?&amp;quot; Luck
added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah!&amp;quot; said Tornado to himself, and fell to thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that Fairyland that I see over there?&amp;quot; he asked after
a while, pointing to a misty island far away. He had noticed
it when he first arrived at the beach. Very dim and distant
it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck's expression and voice were graver as she answered.
&amp;quot;You would find it difficult to land there,&amp;quot; she told him. &amp;quot;That
is called Hi Bresil by some, by others the Isle of Avalon. The
souls of those who perish on some high adventure go there.
It is where King Arthur went to rest after his last battle and
before he came back to take possession of his two kingdoms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;His two kingdoms?&amp;quot; Tornado exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; replied Luck, &amp;quot;for does he not reign for ever in the
hearts of the young — and in Fairyland?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned and looked at her sister, exchanging an understanding
smile, then turned back to Tornado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And now we must leave you,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;There is your
boat. Follow that gull with the black patch on his wing, and
he will guide you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sisters drew aside and waited, and though Tornado
could have gone on talking with them for ever, he realised by
the tone of the girl's voice, as also by the smile he had seen on
both their faces, that it was time for him to go. He, at any
rate, was not one of those who never take a risk, he tried to
assure himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got into the boat and stepped the mast. A light wind
had sprung up, blowing off the land. He said good-bye to the
two girls and pushed off boldly. He set the sail. Gaily the
little craft slid through the water towards its strange and distant
goal, as, looking back, he saw Luck and Chance still standing
on the yellow beach, side by side, watching him. He waved his
hand and they waved back. A moment later, when he turned
again, he saw them turn and walk away inland till they disappeared
among the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gull flew steadily ahead, occasionally soaring high up
into the blue, at other times diving down and lightly skimming
the tops of the waves. Sometimes it flew round and round the
boat for a few moments, passing close to Tornado's head and
peering into his face with its bright peeping eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind increased the farther he left the shore, and
Tornado found that his little boat was really travelling quite
fast through the water. He soon lost sight of land, and only
the misty shores of Hi Bresil were visible far ahead. He must
have sailed like this for some hours before he discerned a dark
spot on the horizon. The wind was rising all this time, and his
boat seemed to travel ever faster and faster, leaping from wave
to wave like a thing possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past hour or two he had been afraid of driving
her under and had cased her occasionally, but seeing how bravely
she sailed he now let her have her head, comforting himself
with the thought that she was a magic boat in any case and
ought to know how to keep afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land drew nearer. He was now rapidly getting near
enough to distinguish details. Tall hills, he saw, rose inland,
but close along the shore the ground seemed to be flat and
wooded. He could see no signs of houses or inhabitants. The
coast appeared utterly deserted. But it was also an iron-bound
coast. Great rocks jutted out into the sea and the waves broke
white over them. The flat portions of the shore, he now saw,
were few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked impossible for a small boat to make the land;
but Tornado, with blind faith in the gull, followed where it led —
straight in towards the rocks. Once or twice, he noticed, the
bird turned its head quickly as though to reassure him. Nearer
and nearer they came, and though he felt a little sick with fear,
there was no turning back now. The roar of the surf thundered
all round him, the spray wet his face, and the boat felt the surge
of the great combers as they hurled themselves over the jagged
rocks. He held his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last moment, when everything seemed lost, a narrow
channel opened suddenly before him, and the little boat swept
through between the dangerous rocky walls into a tiny cove.
Once inside, all was quiet. The wind, shut off by the high walls
all round, hardly rippled the surface of the blue water which
lapped peacefully along the narrow sandy bay. And, to his
surprise, he saw that there was actually a little pier made of
rough slabs of stone, with a ring of twisted withies to which he
could fasten his boat. A moment later he had tied her up and
leapt ashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gull, as if satisfied that its job was done, flew several
times round his head, screaming shrilly as though to say goodbye,
and then headed straight out to sea. Tornado waved his
hand in farewell. He fancied he saw it flirt its wing with the
black spot by way of answer. He watched it disappear into the
blaze of sunshine above the wide blue sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="v"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado stood still for some time, taking stock of his surroundings.
There seemed to be a footpath from the pier that
led directly into the forest. It lost itself at once among the
dense trees. After examining the ground in all directions this
path appeared the only way he could go, for the shore revealed
no openings, and behind him was, of course, the open sea, His
best, his only, plan was to follow where it led, since it must, at
any rate, lead somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now for the dragons!&amp;quot; he thought uneasily, as a wave
of misgiving swept over him. Instinctively, as he started, he
loosened the long hunting knife at his belt, although he knew
quite well that it would be useless against a dragon that really
meant business. The undoubted fact that he was taking a
risk pleased him nevertheless; it proved him worthy of being
admitted to Hi Bresil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he went cautiously along, keeping his eyes on both sides
and in front as well, the trees grew thicker and thicker, larger
and larger, so that at last he appeared to be walking in a kind
of green tunnel, the branches meeting above his head. Here
and there a splash of sunlight stole through and turned some
strange flower by the path into a flaming jewel. His feet made
no sound on the mossy ground. Silent as the grave the forest
was, for no wind stirred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite suddenly, the path led into the open, the trees fell
away, and a large clearing lay before him. Deer were grazing
quietly all over it. Tornado stiffened like a dog scenting
game and almost unconsciously slipped behind a tree to
watch them. There were red deer and fallow, here and there
an occasional roe, while in the distance he saw other deer
that were quite strange to him. But, as his eyes swept the
herds, picking out the best beasts in each, his attention was
suddenly held by the sight of another animal altogether, and a
very weird one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was lying down when he first saw it, but, as he watched,
it rose slowly and stretched itself. Larger than a stag, he noticed,
and coloured like a rocking-horse, dappled black and white,
There was no mistaking what it was when he saw the long straight
horn coming out of the forehead. He caught his breath. It
was the unicorn. Its eyes gazed gently about it, as though,
without being alarmed, it somehow knew that a stranger was
in its neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a gracious, splendid creature!&amp;quot; he exclaimed to
himself as he gazed, and a thrill ran through him, for he knew
that the unicorn roams no other pastures save those of Fairyland,
and that he had, therefore, really arrived,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He must have stood behind his tree for a long time watching
the stately creature, his eyes wandering towards the deer as
well, for he had quite forgotten the matter of dragons being
possibly in the neighbourhood, when there came a sudden roaring
in the sky, and Tornado, quickly looking up, saw six dark shapes
rushing downwards at tremendous speed towards the forest;
indeed, towards the very clearing at whose edge he stood concealed.
What looked like jets of flame preceded them, issuing,
apparently, from their mouths. They made a curious loud
rattling sound, with other noises that were half hooting and
half growling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bless my soul!&amp;quot; he exclaimed. &amp;quot;The dragons!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock to his mind and nerves was very considerable,
yet his interest was so intense that his fear was not more than
he could manage. It was odd, however, that just at this very
moment when his entire attention should have been occupied
with this arresting sight, he found time to think of something
else, &lt;em&gt;viz.&lt;/em&gt;, that he had forgotten something. This certainty
that some familiar object was missing came back again. His
hand flew to his knife, but the knife was in its place. There
was another thing he ought to have had with him, only for
the life of him he could not remember what it was. It was
something he always carried. He used it for protection overhead.
What it was, however, he could not imagine. He had
not got it — that was all he knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought flashed through his mind, then vanished
utterly — and he concentrated all his attention again on the
dragons. They were much lower now, just above the tree-tops,
in fact, and one by one he saw them plane down into the clearing
and settle among the feeding deer as quietly as though they
were so many crows. The deer, too, seemed undisturbed by
their arrival, moving calmly to one side to give them room to
land. The unicorn went on rubbing its horn against a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only they were most certainly not crows. The jets of flame
that had poured out of their nostrils while they were in full
flight had died down, but a red glow showed when they opened
their tremendous mouths, while thin wisps of smoke curled
round their jagged lips and floated upwards into the still air.
Their huge sides rose and fell as they breathed, accompanied
by an odd noise, half rattling, half clanking, that was almost
metallic, and came, it seemed, from their interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado now felt really frightened. The appearance of
these monstrous brutes was chilling to the blood. Any one of
them could have swallowed him at a single gulp; their fiery
breath could burn him to an ash in a moment; a blow from a
single tail — and he would be reduced to a pulp of broken bones
and flesh. They were covered, he saw, with bright green scales
which gave out a clashing sound as they moved, Their legs and
claws were a brilliant scarlet, while their eyes, as large as soup
plates, glowed with alternate red and green as though lit by
some internal fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On landing they had folded their wings, which towered
above their backs fully thirty feet into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stared and stared, and the more he stared the less he
liked them. He realised that their arrival coincided too accurately
with his own; they arrived because he had arrived. The
whole six of them, he noticed, had drawn themselves up directly
opposite to where he hid behind his tree, and the path he had
been following, the only path there was, ran right through the
middle of them. They had arranged themselves with military
precision, three on each side of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peering cautiously round the trunk that sheltered him,
he noticed these details, And his heart sank into his deerskin
sandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet his profound trust in what Luck and Chance had told
him did not waver. So far, he reflected, he had come safely
owing to their guidance. He realised he must trust them to
the end, or else fail to prove himself worthy of his quest. His
muscles, however, were like paper in his legs. He dared not,
could not, move — when, suddenly, he heard a far, shrill cry,
and, looking up, he saw the gull with the spotted wing in the
air above the trees. It circled once, peeped down at him,
uttered its shrill cry a second time, and vanished into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this that decided him to act. Summoning up all his
courage, he took the risk. He stepped out from behind his
tree and walked slowly but steadily forwards in the direction
of the waiting dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearer he drew to them the less he liked it. His blood
was water. He trembled. But he walked fairly straight,
giving no outward sign of flinching. Only a few yards now
separated him from the first couple in the dreadful row, and
he realised that there was only just room to pass between them
without actually touching. The slightest stumble, leaning an
inch to right or left, would mean that he would brush the awful
jaws. Indeed, as he moved slowly forward, the dragon on the
right yawned widely, showing an enormous mouth with huge
pointed teeth and a red tongue that flickered in and out with
a ghastly significance. It was licking its great lips, of course.
But the behaviour of its companion facing it on the left seemed
even more ominous, for its immense tail began to twitch and
swing from side to side like the tail of a cat before it springs.
It seemed to be gathering its vast legs under it as a kitten does
when it leaps playfully at a ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado felt himself as the ball. His body dripped with
perspiration. His legs only just supported him. But he still
kept moving with slow steps forward, nearer and ever nearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last he was actually between the first pair of mighty
heads. The creatures eyed him, but did not move. He passed
slowly onwards. He reached the second pair, whose eyes
similarly followed him, the bodies keeping motionless. A
whiff of burning brimstone came to his nostrils, blended,
he fancied, with another smell that was curiously familiar,
though he could not name it. He knew the name, but it
had vanished with another part of his life which, equally, was
forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dragons, as he passed further between four more pairs
of heads, never moved, though following him steadily with
their fiery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When half way down the line Tornado only just controlled
a violent impulse to make a sudden run for it. It occurred to
him to dash wildly forward as fast as ever he could sprint — and
trust to luck. But as the idea took form in his mind, the words
&amp;quot;trust to Luck&amp;quot; brought the quick knowledge that to carry
out his plan would betray cowardice and failure. To trust to
Luck and Chance was not to run away. There was Destiny.
And Destiny, though implacable, obeyed courage and determination.
He held on his dreadful way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the end came, at last, without disaster. He passed
the final pair of monsters safely. Not one of the dragons had
moved. Now that he was beyond them, though only a few
feet, they still crouched unmoved upon the forest sward. Joy!
He had not failed himself! He had proved worthy of the
heritage of Hi Bresil, if only by the skin of his teeth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying not to break into a run, Tornado, his breath irregular,
his heart thumping like a little drum, followed the path. The
unicorn came close, lowered its stately head, and nuzzled his
shoulder with its dangerous pointed horn. He looked a moment
into its gentle eyes. The herds of deer divided quietly to let
him pass, then fell to feeding again, quite undisturbed. In
fact, he had to wait once while a large company of them crossed
in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had not looked back as yet, but now he heard suddenly
a tremendous rattling clatter, a hissing and a hooting, and,
turning his head, he saw the great dragons take the air. It
was a wondrous sight. They rose without effort, snorting fire
and smoke, their scales making a din of clanking metal, and,
once above the trees, he saw the whole six pass across the sky
in a wedge-shape formation like a skein of monstrous geese.
They became smaller and smaller as they rose into upper space,
their roaring died away, they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the deer nor the unicorn, he noticed, paid the
slightest attention to this great commotion. Silence and peace
descended again upon the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vi"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VI.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado drew a deep breath and felt happier than ever in
his life before. Such happiness seemed incredible, yet he experienced
it. He was coming closer and closer to something he
had always yearned for. He longed to wait a while and make
closer friends with the attractive unicorn, but some instinct
warned him that he must not linger, but should push on farther,
for the climax of what he sought lay yet in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had now reached the far side of the clearing. The sun
was sinking, the shadows growing longer. He began to think
vaguely about food, about where and how he was going to sleep
as well. He was not tired, but sleep when the sun went down
seemed natural. Should he lie down on the moss and ferns?
Should he look about for berries? The music of a tinkling
stream reminded him that he was thirsty. He knelt down and
drank his fill of sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he rose to his feet again the forest, it seemed, wore
another look. It was not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same as when he knelt down
a minute ago. He gazed about him. There was a certain
curious change, he fancied. He felt he had seen it before. The
fringe of the woods he was now approaching wore almost a
familiar guise. This old impression grew stronger as he walked
slowly on. The path, unless he was mistaken, would presently
take a sharp turn to the left just beyond that old gnarled oak
tree. There would be a cottage with a pool of water beside it.
He would go up and knock on the door, and the door would
open …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, it proved exactly as he imagined. Leaving
the forest, the path turned sharply to the left. There stood the
cottage, the cottage of his desires, and the pool that he had
loved so long in dream. And that figure among the sunflowers,
was it Luck or Chance? He could not quite see. It disappeared
behind the rows of sunflowers where he saw the unicorn gazing
gently at him over the towering foxgloves. It was coming in
by the way back, of course, to open to him. His heart rose
triumphantly within him. He wanted to shout and sing. He
had at last come — Home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado, his blood pulsing with this happiness, strode
boldly up to the door. He knocked confidently. He stood
waiting a moment. No one came at first. He knocked again,
but still no one came; there was no sound of a footfall. A
vague feeling of disquietude stole over him. Ah! there was
another way of getting in, he seemed to remember, and his hand
went automatically down the side of his leg as if hunting for
something he expected to find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a pocket he sought? His pocket, at any rate, was
there as usual. The thing he looked for, too, lay hard and
firm inside it. He drew out his key and inserted it without
effort in the lock. The door opened easily as usual. He went
in, also as usual. There before him stood his girl-secretary, a
pile of letters behind her on the desk, again as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bell was ringing impatiently, ringing, ringing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl's face wore a half reproachful look as she bade him
respectfully good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A little late, am I … ?&amp;quot; offered Mr. T. Smith, a
trifle apologetically. &amp;quot;I — er — walked the whole way, I'm
afraid. The morning,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;was so fine, you know … &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Mr. Smith,&amp;quot; replied the girl. &amp;quot;A pity it's clouded
over since.&amp;quot; She turned away to answer the telephone, which
kept on ringing, ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as she said the words he noticed that the first early
brilliance indeed had passed. The sky outside was dark and
lowering. Rain obviously threatened. The girl was gabbling
at the telephone. He waited, listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Miss Slumbubble, sir,&amp;quot; she reported, laying the receiver
down. &amp;quot;To say you forgot your umbrella. She's sending it at
once by messenger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh — ah — yes,&amp;quot; he murmured vaguely. &amp;quot;I — knew I had
forgotten — something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced at his watch. After all, he was only fifteen
minutes late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps another fifteen minutes had passed when a
small messenger boy arrived with his umbrella, offering a piece
of blue paper which Mr. T. Smith signed by way of receipt,
having first paid the little bright-eyed lad a shilling. He signed,
without thinking, &amp;quot;Tornado Smith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;by Algernon Blackwood (1928)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Illustration from the original publication." src="/blog-en/img/algernon-blackwood_when-nick-dressed-up/algernon-blackwood_when-nick-dressed-up.jpg" style="width: 25em;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick, with the red hair, had been naughty. How naughty is
not known, but it must have been pretty bad, for the governess called
him &amp;quot;Nicholas,&amp;quot; and sent him to his room for the rest of the afternoon.
Instead of going out to play in the sunshine he was to stay indoors
alone. She locked him in too. He heard her footsteps going down
the passage. They died away. Downstairs, in the depth of the silent
house, they presently ceased altogether. He was alone. He began
to look about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room he was locked up in was not really his own bedroom,
it was a box-room. Boxes of every sort and kind stood piled up
against the walls. In the slanting roof was a large skylight window
that let the light in, and the first thing Nick did was to drag an
empty packing-case and climb up so that he could peep out. Being
nine years old and rather tall for his age, he could just manage
it. He poked his nose over the edge and stared down at the garden
in the sunshine, and saw the governess walking across the lawn with
a big book under her arm. She was going towards the summer-house,
where the gardener was mowing the grass with the fat Shetland pony.
He watched her. Five minutes later she was deep in her book, lying
full length in a deck-chair. Ten minutes later he saw the book slip
to the ground. She was asleep. Nick scrambled back on to the floor.
&amp;quot;Ha! Ha!&amp;quot; he said to himself, and clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the fact of her being asleep that somehow suggested to
him the idea of escaping. She wouldn't hear, for one thing; for
another, she wouldn't see. He went over and tried the door. It
was really locked. He shook it till it rattled, when suddenly, to his
surprise and delight, the key shook loose and fell with a clatter to the
floor. It made such a noise, however, that he was afraid she must
have heard it even across the lawn. So he climbed up again on his
packing-case to look. No! She was still asleep. He almost fancied
he could hear her snore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just as he was carefully climbing down again, a strange
thing happened. Right under his nose it happened. He saw a mouse
run over the floor. He stared. He watched it. He said &amp;quot;Hist!
Hist!&amp;quot; It darted first one way, then another. It was hunting for
its hole, terrified of the big human figure in the air above it. He leaped
down to chase it. The same second it vanished. It had escaped, but
not into its hole. It had run &lt;em&gt;under the door&lt;/em&gt;. The old door fitted
badly. There was a crack between it and the floor. &amp;quot;Ho! Ho!&amp;quot;
said the boy to himself, and clicked his tongue again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick was on his hands and knees in a moment. He could see
the key lying on the landing just outside. With the help of a long
nail he found loose in the wall he could just reach it. In a very short
space of time the key was under the crack and in his hand. Two
seconds later the door was unlocked and Nick was free! &amp;quot;Good
little mouse!&amp;quot; he said to himself in a whisper. &amp;quot;I believe you
showed me the way on purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do next was the question now. After thinking things
over for a minute or two, he then locked himself in. He did this
with a reason. He had an idea, this naughty Nick. He meant to
escape, of course, but his idea was first to disguise himself, so that if
anybody met him downstairs they wouldn't know who he was. But
he did not want to be interrupted while dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the boxes that gave him this idea of disguise, and he began
his search at once. Nick was not the kind to waste time. Besides,
the governess might wake up and climb the stairs to see if he was
still there. In less than ten minutes every box that would open was
open, their contents littered all over the floor. Nick scratched his
red head and stared at the collection, wondering what was best to
wear, wondering also what would fit him. His safety depended on
his choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a problem: the dusty floor was covered with garments
of every description — from Wellington boots his father sometimes
wore, to uniforms, fur coats in camphor, gun-cases, rugs, shawls,
blankets, and a lot of female clothes he could not name at all. He
examined them one by one, scratching his head and sighing. There
seemed nothing he could use. The smell of camphor was quite
sickly. Slowly, with disappointment in his heart, he began to put
them back into their various boxes, when suddenly something shining
caught his eye. It gleamed, it was white, it was pointed, it was — yes,
it was — a tooth. More — it was a row of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked it up gingerly, and an animal head and muzzle came
up with it from the pile. A whole skin followed. He held his breath
and stared, for it seemed he recognized it. He stared again. He did
recognize it. It was the pantomime bear-skin his father used to put
on at Christmas when the children were quite small, and when Father,
too, was smaller than he was now. He had grown too big for it;
the children, Nick among them, had also grown too big for such
nonsense. But it was a wonderful bear-skin. You could get inside
it, head and all, and there was something you squeezed like a bulb
so that it made a noise that sounded as if a bear was growling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later Nick was inside it, practising. It fitted him
fairly well, though the tail and shoulders dragged a little. He stuffed
some shawls in to make it fuller. The growl, when he squeezed the
bulb, was like a motor-car before it starts. He could walk about in
it, he could stretch his arms, he could open and shut the mouth
with the great white gleaming teeth, and when he pressed the bulb
and growled he felt exactly as if he was a real bear. There were narrow
slits below the eyes he could see through. The disguise was perfect.
No one could possibly recognize him. &amp;quot;Hee! Hee!&amp;quot; he said to
himself excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing was — where to go; but before that he must
make sure the governess was still asleep, or at least still in the summer-house.
So, slipping his head free, he clambered up once more to the
skylight window and peered over the edge. To his horror, he saw
that she was no longer in the deck-chair; the summer-house was
empty. She must be in the house below, on her way, perhaps, to
come and let him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same moment he caught the sound of a footstep on the
stairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-headed boys, especially naughty red-headed boys, think
quickly. His mind was made up in a second. He sprang down,
darted out on to the landing as rapidly as the great skin allowed,
shut the door and locked it, and then stood motionless against the
wall, waiting for her to come up. He hoped she would think it was
a stuffed bear — there were two stuffed bears in the hall below — standing on
its hind legs. He kept still as a mouse, holding his arms out
like the bears in the hall. And the steps came slowly, slowly nearer.
Peeping through the narrow slits he could see clearly. It was the
governess. She reached the top stair, passed him so close that she
actually touched him, unlocked the door, and walked inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick held his breath, not daring to turn his head; but he knew
she was looking round the box-room to find him. She had not noticed
the &amp;quot;stuffed bear&amp;quot; evidently, because she was so accustomed to the
couple in the hall. If she noticed it at all, she thought this was just
an extra one that was kept upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas, where are you?&amp;quot; he heard. &amp;quot;If you are good now,
and will say you're sorry, you may come out!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no answer. He heard her move forward into the
room. The light was dim, for it was drawing towards evening and
shadows lay thickly in the corners. The landing, too, where he stood
was rather dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas! Do you hear me?&amp;quot; came in a louder voice. There
was still, of course, no answer. Slowly, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowly, Nick turned his
head. He could see her searching for him, rummaging among the
piled-up boxes. He had put all the things back in their places again,
and there was no sign of disorder. He watched her. She was stooping
down now, peering behind a great packing-case, calling out,
&amp;quot;Nicholas! Nicholas! Come out at once!&amp;quot; when he suddenly
bent over, put his terrible head round the corner, pressed the bulb,
and swung his arms about in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governess turned, saw the great bear behind her, heard its
awful growl, opened her mouth, screamed, and fell back against the
wall, knocking a large hamper over as she did so. The noise and
clatter were tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Help! Help! Murder!&amp;quot; screamed the governess at the top
of her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nick did not wait to help. He knew she would recover in
a moment. She was only startled, really. Kicking the door to with
a hind leg, he turned and ran downstairs as fast as ever he could go.
He heard the door bang behind him, but the next minute, and before
he was further than the second landing, he heard it open again, and
out came the frightened governess, still yelling &amp;quot;Help! Help!&amp;quot; and
flopping down the stairs after him as though a murderer were at her
heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she had guessed who the bear was and was chasing
&lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, Nick didn't know; probably she was too frightened to think
of anything except her own safety and was flying to some room
where she could lock herself in and feel secure. Anyhow, she came
thumping down the stairs behind him, only so slowly that he was
down the second flight before she even reached the landing above.
And at the bottom of this second flight, sitting on the tiger rug in
the hall, he now saw Smoke, the fat grey Persian cat. The cat, at the
same time, saw — him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke, as a rule, was too lazy even to play. She was enormously
fat; she never made a quick movement of any sort unless she could
help it. But when she saw this great bear with gleaming teeth come
tumbling headlong down the front stairs into the hall she rose
suddenly, arched her back, stuck her tail like a rod into the air, hissed,
spat, jumped sideways — and was out of the hall as quick as lightning.
She shot through an open door into the drawing-room, where the
French windows stood wide. A second later she was scampering
across the lawn as though a dozen terriers were at her heels. And
Nick was following her. He, too, darted into the drawing-room, out
through the windows, and tore across the lawn towards the summer-house.
Into this summer-house Smoke disappeared like some
mysterious shadow. Nick, following a moment later, also disappeared
from view. The governess, having now reached the open drawing-room
windows, looked across the lawn, saw nothing but the
gardener and the pony with the lawn-mower, and, mopping her
face with her handkerchief, turned round and went back into the
house again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly had she turned her back, however, when Nick, finding
the cat behind the box of croquet mallets, produced such an alarming
growl that Smoke, perhaps in play, perhaps in genuine fright, shot
out of the summer-house again like a flash of light, and Nick, the
bear, flashed after her. They emerged almost together, and so suddenly
that neither of them noticed the Shetland pony that was drawing
the lawn-mower at that moment exactly past the opening. The
pony, on the other hand, noticed both of them — a flying cat and a
racing bear — just beneath its nose, at its very feet in fact. And this
unusual sight so alarmed the pony that it flung up its heels, shook
its head violently, and began to kick. It kicked the pile of cut grass
completely upside down, so that the fine stuff flew into the gardener's
face and made him cough and choke. The shower of grass fell all
over him like rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weedon, the gardener, was extremely surprised, for he had
never seen the lazy pony do anything violent before, but a moment
later he had shaken the grass out of his mouth and eyes and quieted
the animal, when, as he turned round, he saw the sight of his life —
a bear chasing a cat into the drawing-room window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I never —!&amp;quot; exclaimed Weedon, wondering if he was
going to be ill — and promptly gave chase himself. The pony, accustomed
to follow him, thought it was expected to do so now, and began
to drag the mower slowly after him towards the house. Just as
Weedon, who was not very fast on his feet, reached the open window,
out shot Smoke, the fat Persian cat, between his legs, the bear after
it again, and following the bear — the governess. There followed a
general collision: Weedon fell backwards into a geranium bed close
to the Shetland pony, who had now reached the edge of the lawn
and was nibbling the flowers; the governess tripped over Weedon
and pitched headlong into a rose bush; the bear stumbled over the
cat and went head over heels along the gravel path. Only the cat
kept its feet. Smoke, tail in air and whiskers bristling, shot on ahead
faster than ever in the direction of the front door of the house, which
now, for some reason, stood open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the pile of people on the ground became gradually
disentangled. Weedon helped the governess to her feet, then
pushed the pony away from the flowers, telling it to behave itself
and not eat geraniums; the bear stood upright, peeping out of its
narrow slits. There was a general puffing and blowing, and the
governess this time did not scream, because she had no breath left
in her lungs. Nick, however, quicker than the others, had seen the
cat's tail disappearing through the open front door, and, before anybody
could say &amp;quot;knife,&amp;quot; was after it. Following him as before, but
much more slowly, came the lumbering Weedon and the unsteady
governess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick reached the door and plunged headlong through it into the
hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the final disaster. For at this very moment Thompson,
the butler, happened to be crossing the hall with a tray, on his
way to the morning-room. Luckily, there was nothing on the tray
but a jug of hot water he was taking to the grown-ups' tea. It was
quite enough, however. The cat flew past his feet like a grey shadow,
but the bear landed full tilt against his middle, upsetting Thompson
himself, the tray, and the jug of hot water. They all fell at the same
moment, with a thundering noise, and it was only five seconds later,
before any of them had time to get up again, that the morning-room
door opened and a stern male voice cried: &amp;quot;What on earth is all
this noise about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Father. He had come in by the back way from riding,
and was just sitting down to his quiet cup of afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he saw, as he stared across the hall, was a sight to be
remembered. Thompson was sitting on the floor, his red face
drenched in water; a bear crouched on all fours beside him, in the
act of getting up; on the mat by the front door stood the governess,
who had just arrived, her hair coming down, her arms waving; and
behind her was Weedon, the gardener, fine-cut grass still clinging
to his hat and neck and shoulders; while, just beyond him, shoving
his head almost against his coat, was the Shetland pony, which had
managed somehow to get loose from the mower and had followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment Father stood and stared. His face at first grew
dark, but then gradually relaxed; the lines about the mouth softened;
a twinkle crept into his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this the Zoological Gardens?&amp;quot; he enquired in his deep
voice, &amp;quot;or is it, perhaps, only a — bear-garden?&amp;quot; And his gaze
rested on the bear, who had now managed to stand upright, facing
him. In these few seconds he had quickly discovered who the chief
culprit was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answer came. Thompson shuffled off to fetch more hot
water from the pantry; Weedon, touching his hat, turned round
and led the pony away from the hall door; the governess, tidying
her hair as best she could, opened her mouth to explain matters, but
found she had no breath. She moved slowly towards the door that
led to the back stairs and disappeared. Only the bear was left. It
was rather a frightened bear, it neither stirred nor growled, it stood
there waiting for what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what have you been up to this time?&amp;quot; said Father,
gruffly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only — dressing up,&amp;quot; came the faint reply from inside the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A dressing down is what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need,&amp;quot; said the gruff voice, and,
caught up in the big arms, the bear was carried bodily into the
morning-room. The dressing down, however, was apparently not a
very painful matter, for a good deal of laughter was heard inside the
room, and when Thompson returned with the hot water he saw Nick's
red head sticking out of the skin, its mouth busy with jam and
bread-and-butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing, at any rate, Nick had to do, and that was to say he
was sorry to everybody he had upset. First to the governess, then
to the butler, then to Weedon, then to the pony, and last of all to
Smoke, the Persian cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Ho!&amp;quot; he said to himself when these apologies were all
over. &amp;quot;It was worth it, anyhow!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- “Once upon a time, in a far-off land, malpractice carried an arcane penalty.” --&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hung so conspicuously there amid the
surrounding mop of fine dark hair that
it piqued the curiosity of Dr Blane's
friends more than any other detail of his
very distinguished appearance. Grief,
said a good number, had caused it;
anxiety, declared others; but the majority,
including servants and women
plumped, of course, for love. He was
successful, and he was unmarried; the
evidence was unanswerable. I believe,
however, that I am the only living person
who holds the true secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people who have really lived,”
he used to say, “possess some singular experience
or other that they do not care
about telling indiscriminately. And this
is mine. I'm a little ashamed of it,” he
added, “for nowadays we explain everything--
or confess ourselves unscientific.
Besides”--he shrugged his shoulders--&amp;quot;my
conduct, I always feel, was not strictly
professional perhaps in the best sense.
And, also--it was the only time in my
life when I was obliged to acknowledge
a sense of unreasoning fear--and yield
to it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the story, it must be confessed,
certainly would have claimed belief more
readily in those picturesque times when
“Possession,” diabolical or otherwise, was
a prevalent superstition, and when the
post mortem activity of a disembodied
spirit was held to be often exceedingly
lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened before the days when Dr
Blane's skill had earned for him the
honours of knighthood, together with the
privilege of inspectorship of royal diseases.
This, somewhat, is as he told it to me
shortly before his own death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an intimate friend, it appears, he
was revisiting a little village in the Swiss
Jura, where he had been to learn French
as a boy, when the friend incontinently
was laid low with diphtheria, and he
stayed out perforce to nurse him. Both
men had their meals in the cosy little
Pension de La Poste, where twenty years
before they had studied grammar and
irregular verbs together; but Dr Blane,
who wanted quiet, had his work and bedroom
in Michaud's new house at the other
end of the village where the yards begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the epidemic, it so happened, was
a severe one, and two other persons- — but
for whom this thing might not have come
about- — were also laid low: one, the village
æsculapius, Dr Ducommun; the other,
Mlle. Udriet, a wealthy but avaricious old
woman, whose personality was of dark
and sinister odour throughout the whole
countryside, and who, on account of her
intense miserliness, was known generally
as “la mauvaise riche.” And she was
well named, for village wit has a way of
hitting the nail on the head. She was
an evil woman, with great force of individuality,
dreaded by all; and her fear of
spending money went to amazing lengths.
It was even reported of her that she enticed
her neighbours' cats into her big
house, slew and cooked them with her
own hands, and ate them to save a
butcher's bill. Her long finger-nails, and
certain other unappetising peculiarities,
were evidence, the village held for anything
and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Dr Blane, who was sent for to
prescribe in the temporary absence of Dr
Ducommun, admits that the moment he
crossed the threshold of the ill-smelling
room and saw the old miser staring fixedly
at him from her bed, he was inspired by
an instant and singularly powerful aversion
for her. The face he always described
as truly venomous, and her thin
fingers lying on the coverlet were “taloned
and be-clawed,” he used to declare with
a shuddering laugh, “like the feet of a
great bird of prey.” Here, for the first
time in his life, was a patient, he hinted
afterwards, whom he would rather have
helped to die than to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though ashamed of his revulsion he
could not quite conceal it. The fact that
she would never pay his fees was nothing.
It was the woman herself. &amp;quot;She was like
some great loathsome insect in that dark
room,” he said; &amp;quot;some insect whose sting
was death!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation at first was merely unpleasant,
but a little later it became more
awkward and furnished Dr Blane with
the excuse for what he terms his unprofessional
attitude. For the village doctor
got better--well enough to crawl out
and see his pet patients--and la mauvaise
riche got steadily worse. Moreover, she
insisted on sending for Dr Blane because
she preferred his greater skill, and Dr
Blane as often as possible shelved the
unpleasant responsibility upon the shoulders
of the local practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, he avoided seeing her —
even refused point blank to do so, and the
old woman, when she found that he no
longer came, suffered paroxysms of rage
that were positively terrifying in their
concentrated fury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one night towards the end of
March when the matter came to a climax.
Earlier in the evening Mlle. Udriet, apparently
at her crisis, had sent him an imperious
summons, and Dr Blane, not without
pricks of conscience, had passed on
the summons by messenger to his colleague
at the other end of the village.
Dr Ducommun, however, was delayed for
several hours, with the unfortunate result
that la mauvaise riche lay neglected to
the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Englishman, of course, knew nothing
of this. He was in the Pension
sitting by the bedside of his friend, reading.
It was 10 o'clock. Shaded candles
stood on the little table, and the sick man
was sleeping peacefully the sleep of recovery.
For twenty-four hours there had
been no return of the delirium. At the
end of the darkened room Mme. Favre,
who owned the pension and had proved
herself a devoted helper, was in the act
of mixing a tumbler of the St. Germain
— her invariable remedy for all complaints
— when suddenly two things — two surprising
things — happened simultaneously:
the sick man sat bolt upright in bed with
startling abruptness, stared fixedly into
the dim room in front of him, and
pointed; while Mme. Favre let fall her
tumbler with a crash upon the floor and
cried, in a voice of genuine alarm, “Who
is it? Somebody pushed past me!
There's someone else in the room!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular way these two persons
acted on the same instant impressed Dr
Blane unpleasantly — curiously. He was
conscious at once of a disagreeable thrill
— of something that brought the water
with a rush to his eyes and made the
skin of his back crawl. Yet of course
he never for one moment believed that
anyone had really entered the room
through the closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A return of the delirium,” he said
quietly, as his friend continued to glare
about him and to point. And then added
more sternly, “There's no need for alarm,
Mme. Favre, I assure you;” for the old
lady was leaning, pale and terrified,
against the cupboard, and staring towards
the bed as though her eyes would drop
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the patient, of course, absorbed
his immediate attention. To the doctor
there could be nothing very unusual about
a scene of delirium; yet about this particular
scene of delirium, he became
sharply and unpleasantly aware, there
was something very unusual indeed. It
was convincingly and horribly real. To
begin with, though the sick man had forgotten
his French almost to the simplest
phrases, he was now gabbling the language
with a speed and fluency that were
positively uncanny; and at the same time
with a vehemence, a passion, a fury that
had characterised none of his former attacks;
moreover — most disquieting of all —
with a thin, whispering voice that was beyond
question not his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the whole wild torrent, all he,
and for that matter all Mme. Favre, could
catch before it subsided again into abrupt
silence were the short phrases, uttered
with eyes fixed upon the doctor and hand
pointing into his very face: “You passed
me by. But now I am out — and I shall
not pass you by!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular thing, however — and it was
this that gave the good woman the &amp;quot;crise
de nerfs&amp;quot; that ended in a fainting fit — the
singular and horrible thing, was that as the
changed voice poured out of the sick man,
his face altered visibly as well, altered too
into the lineaments of another visage that
they both knew. How the eyes and
mouth of a man could slip into the expression
of a woman — an evil, vindictive
woman — is beyond the power of description,
yet the calm, experienced Dr Blane.
as well as the frightened old lady at the end
of the room, both recognised beyond possibility
of discussion that voice, face, and
manner belonged to the evil personality of
that perverted old woman, la mauvaise
riche. In the eyes, perhaps, the resemblance
lay chiefly. It was unmistakable.
It was weirdly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it all passed as quickly as it came.
The sick man slept peacefully once more,
Mme. Favre pulled herself together, assisted
by the judicious aid of cold water,
and half an hour later Dr Blane, battling
already with vivid sensations of alarm
such as he had never known before in his
life, left the pension to go back to his own
rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shortest way lay down the village
street, past the house of Mlle. Udriet,
and so home. Yet the doctor deliberately
chose the longer route. He admits it
frankly. He did not wish to pass the
woman's house. “I was curiously nervous,
almost frightened,” he said: “though
exactly of what I could not tell. I came
out of La Poste into the night all trembling.
It was the most unaccountable sensation
I have ever known. Rather than
pass the door of that woman's house I'd
have walked a mile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he went home by a roundabout way
of perhaps 15 minutes. The village was
utterly deserted, and the night air swept
about him with the scents of early spring
from the surrounding forests. In his mind,
however, he still saw his friend's changed
face and heard the whispered words so
vindictively uttered, “You passed me by.
Now I'm out. I shan't pass you by!”
And do what he might he could not dismiss
them. The words kept time with
the echo of his feet on the hard road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more than halfway his path
joined the main street by the fountain,
and then turned to the right and ran between
low stone walls to Michaud's house.
Beyond the walls were vineyards with hundreds
of bare sticks already planted in the
earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was here, as he passed the fountain,
that he first heard a noise that sent
the blood tingling up about his ears. The
mountain water splashes there all the year
round with a steady fall, but what he
heard had nothing to do with that. It
was the sound of small feet pattering
along under the deep shadow of the
houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was following him. “It's a
dog,” he said, yet at the same time he
knew quite well it was not a dog. It
was on two feet, not on four. Fear dropped
cold and wet over his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road slopes the whole way to where
the Michaud house stands isolated from
the rest of the village among the vineyards,
and Dr Blane quickened his pace
almost to a run. He found the excuse
that it was cold, though he was perfectly
well aware that the cold he felt was not
common cold of night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time he resisted the desire to look
round, but before he was half-way down
the hill the moon emerged from the clouds,
and at last, with a sudden movement as
though he expected to be attacked from behind,
he stopped short, and turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village street in the pale wintry
moonlight was empty. Black shadows
lined its sides; the church pierced the
sky; far above gleamed the spectral snows
on the heights of Mont Racine, and the
great mountain of Boudry with its dark
army of pines hung, immense and forbidding,
in the air. Nothing moved.
But from the spaces of open moonlit road
close behind him came the sound of light
pattering. The steps still followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this creeping fear had begun
to master him was beyond all things
strange. He pulled himself together with
a great effort of will and continued his
way, this time without undue haste; for
to run, he realised, was to admit that
terror was in his heart. Yet, along some
dark by-way, it had undoubtedly established
itself already in his blood beyond
all reach of argument. He walked with
firm and measured steps, and as a result
he at once noticed that the sounds were
no longer audible. The moment he asserted
his will, apparently they ceased.
The whole thing was, of course, imaginary,
born of the night, of the deep wintry
silence, and of the unpleasant memory that
vivid scene in the sickroom had marked
on his brain — in a word, nerves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the village behind him, he entered
the section of road where low walls
separated it from the vineyards on either
side. But before he had gone a dozen
yards he became aware that something
was running stealthily among the serried
ranks of vine sticks over the wall on his
left. The soft pattering on the earth was
distinctly audible. The thing was keeping
pace with him still, yet always a little
behind. It was holding him in view —
watching; waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This,” he says, “I realised above all
else — that I was being followed with some
sinister purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping to the middle of the road, however,
Dr Blane refused now to quicken his
steps. It was remarkable how dead, how
deserted the mountain village seemed. No
one was about; lights were out in every
house. Wind, the night, and the timid
moon with her fugitive gleams held possession
of the world. And those swift,
pattering footsteps, making their way
without a single false tread between thousands
of upright stakes, ran ever beside
him on the other side of the low wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last the outline of the house loomed
welcome before him, and he entered the
iron gates, slowly, still master of himself,
and fumbled in the lock with his key. A
space of gravel path led up to the door,
and as he stooped to insert the key he
was positive that he heard something leap
the wall and land with a kind of hushed
shuffle on the shingly path close behind
him. He turned with an exclamation, half
cry, half curse — again with the instinctive
idea of protecting himself from attack,
when suddenly a light shone through
the door, and Michaud, his landlord,
opened it from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sounds ceased; Dr Blane passed
hurriedly in. Never was light or human
presence more welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'll close after you,” said Michaud, a
little man with a jolly, smiling fat face.
“I knew your step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before shutting the door he peered out
into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tiens!” he said, looking about him,
“I thought I heard someone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's a dog or something that followed
me down the road,” said the doctor. He
was glad to be with another man — uncommonly
glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud closed the door and locked it,
but as he did so Dr Blane got the curious
impression that something darted in past
his legs like a swift shadow into the house.
At the same moment the lantern standing
on the steps behind fell with a crash,
as though knocked over, and the light
was extinguished. Michaud laughed as
he struck a match to relight it. He
looked rather closely at his lodger for a
moment. Dr Blane declares that to the
end he could never be certain that he
had not himself stumbled against the lantern
and so kicked it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been here several times to
fetch you,” the man said the moment the
door was fastened, “but I told them
you were out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who came?&amp;quot; asked the other with an
odd catch in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't see. I called down from
the window, but didn't recognise the
voice — some woman, I think. It was too
dark to see. I told them to get Dr
Ducommun. She's dead, you know,” he
added abruptly. “Gone to her account
at last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who — who is dead?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud's voice was curiously hushed
as he replied: “La mauvaise riche.” He
shrugged his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently they said good-night, and Dr
Blane went up to his room to work
or to sleep. They were alone in the
house, these two, for Madame Michaud
was away visiting her mother at La Chaux-
de-Fonds, and there were no other occupants.
He heard the little man thumping
about for a space in his bedroom below.
Then, presently all sounds ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Blane's room was on the top floor —
an attic room really. There were double
windows, a cupboard, a bed in one corner
with a mountainous duvet, hot-air pipes,
a wash-hand stand opposite, and in the
centre his work-table with two lighted
candles. By the bed and table two strips
of carpet — the rest pine boards, not even
stained. It was all very primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he tried to work — in vain.
Then, turning his thoughts inwards, he
deliberately attacked the problem with a
view to solving it and recovering his normal
state of balance. He brought to
bear upon it all the force of his acute
mind, together with his great medical
knowledge and experience. But analysis
only confirmed things: he was suffering
from a singular invasion of utterly unreasoning
fear. He was afraid in the
depths of his soul; cold and perspiring
in turns; horribly creepy about the skin;
and his hair ready at the least sound to
rise upon his head. Yet, in his search,
he could find nothing that seemed an
adequate cause. His neglect of a patient,
not even properly his, he admitted, was
not wholly pardonable, but, after all — !
His mind, in spite of all efforts, came
back always to the thought of that horrible
changed expression in his friend's
face — the expression of that evil woman's
eyes, and to the whispered words that had
seemed like a curse. “I'm out. You
passed me by. I shall not pass you
by!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to steady his mind, and possibly
to find a measure of relief in expression,
he sat down to put an analysis of
his mental state on paper. He worked
hard. But presently he paused and
looked about him. He heard the wind.
It had changed; and la bise was blowing
up over the Lake of Neuchatel. Now
and again it rose to a wild, whistling
cry that made him shiver. The clocks
of Colombier struck 1 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At length, in a calmer state of mind,
Dr Blane, half wondering, half laughing,
but still strangely nervous, put out the
candles and got into bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the moment the room was dark the
noise began again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no interval of guesswork; he
knew at once what it was. Something
was scratching at the door — outside. And
the curious part of it was that the instant
he heard it he realised that the door was
no sort of protection. That it was locked
was all a useless pretence. The thing
could, and would, get in to him. And
the next minute, with a nauseous rush
of terror, he knew that it was in. It
had somehow squeezed itself underneath
the door — and was pattering across the
bare boards to the side of his bed. And
as he heard it, that vile pattering seemed
inside him — on the very substance of his
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual distance between door and
bed was small enough, but in those few
seconds of tense horror it stretched into
a hundred yards, and he knew all the
prolonged agony of steady, merciless approach
that a man fastened to the rails
must know when in the distance he hears
the first rumble of the coming train. For
a kind of paralysis crept over him so that
he could not move. His heart dropped
like lead. The perspiration that drenched
him froze instantly into ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the steps quickened for a running
leap: there was a sound of rushing
through the air; a gust of glacial
wind; and something dropped heavily
upon the bed by his feet — and then began
to climb quickly upwards towards his
face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Blane says he tried furiously to
shout, but could get no sound out above
a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensation of the footsteps treading
up the whole length of his paralysed body
was the most horrible thing he had ever
known. But his climax of terror brought
with it at least a certain power of movement,
and he was just able to bury his face
beneath a pile of clothes and pillows when
the thing settled down with a clinging
grip like wire netting upon his head,
and there began the most dreadful
struggle imaginable in the thick darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was an unequal fight. His
hands were so moist with the clamminess
of fear that the sheets slipped through
his fingers, and inch by inch the strength
of his adversary succeeded in uncovering
his face. First he felt it against the
skin of his neck, where thin fingers that
gripped like cold iron caught him behind
in a suddenly exposed place. The rest
went swiftly; for that touch of ice somehow
seemed to paralyse all the nerve
centres at a stroke and bereft him of any
power he had left. In a moment the
clothes were torn from off him, and he
lay there helpless and motionless on his
back, his face at last wholly uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, so close to his ear that the
breath touched him as though the bise
had forced a way in through the open
window, he heard a thin whisper of
words: “You passed me by. Now I'm
out. I shall not pass you by!” and immediately
after it came a smothering sensation
over eyes and mouth as though a
weight of snow had fallen to suffocate
him, while creeping through it a stinging
pain moved slowly down the sides of his
face towards the throat. It was like
claws of iron entering his flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freezing air of night blowing upon
his face revived him after what must have
been a long period of unconsciousness,
for the grey light of early morning was
in this room when he opened his eyes
again and there was a sound of movement
in the house below. With the precision
of a strong mind accustomed to quick reflection
and decision Dr Blane at once
realised the situation. There was no
groping of memory. It all came back
vividly, and in that very first minute of
returning consciousness he was aware
clearly of two things: first, that it had
all been real, and no dream; secondly,
that the terror had passed completely
from his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholly master of himself, yet with a
feeling that he was bruised and battered,
he got out of bed and examined the room.
And to his amazement he noticed for the
first time that the double windows were
wide open and the bise was blowing
straight into the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering greatly — for they had been
closed and fastened when he went to bed —
to shut them tight. Then he crossed the
floor to turn on the supply of hot air in
the radiator. It was on his way back
that he caught the reflection of his face in
the mirror that hung by the window.
The morning light fell full upon it. Down
both cheeks ran dull red lines that ended
in marks round the neck like the marks
of the rope he had known years before as
prison doctor on the neck of a hanged
man. There was no blood — merely a
dull contusion under the skin — and almost
as he looked the lines faded away and
were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But above them, signature of his great
terror was something else that did not
fade, and that remained to the day of his
death. A lock of hair over the right
temple had turned grey in a single night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Lady Rose was always sorry when her parents
left the country and came up to the big London house
for what they called the Season. She liked their own
woods and gardens much better than Hyde Park or Kensington
Gardens, where the formal flower-beds seemed less wonderful
than the primroses and anemones that blew wild at home.
She missed her friend Basseker as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker was Head Gardener. He had been in the family's
service long before she was born, and his knowledge of flowers
and shrubs, of everything that grew in the earth, was very
great indeed. It was &amp;quot;instinctive,&amp;quot; apparently, whatever that
might mean. &amp;quot;His instinct for the soil,&amp;quot; she once heard her
father say, &amp;quot;is really quite astonishing. I believe the fellow
was born underground among the roots!&amp;quot; He laughed as
he said it, but the idea of living underground made a deep
impression upon little Lady Rose's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker was a big, broad, powerful man, with a rumbling
booming voice that rose from his boots. A thick, brown,
bushy beard covered his mouth so that his lips might have
been anywhere. The tangle of hair ran like a jungle all over
his face. She thought of him as a great, delicious, earthy
being that made things grow. A smell of ripe apples, bast
and potting-sheds hung about him. She had an idea that
he was once clean-shaven, but had fallen asleep on Midsummer's
Night and waked next morning with this dense
growth all over his chin and cheeks. It had come out of the
rich black earth he loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a very gentle giant in spite of his alarming voice.
He shared all the mysteries of the garden with her. They
were very great friends. She longed to ask him if he really
lived underground, but could never quite screw her courage
up to the point. It seemed rather an impertinent question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're going to London next week, Basseker,&amp;quot; she now
informed him. &amp;quot;Mother wants the Season, you know.
You'll keep everything growing while we're away, won't
you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes, Missie,&amp;quot; rolled the deep voice — Basseker never
called her &amp;quot;your ladyship&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;and I'll be bringing up some
flowers for the big Parties sometimes, maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I shall see you, Basseker!&amp;quot; and she clapped her
hands. &amp;quot;That's lovely. I shall be in London all the Season,
I'm afraid, you see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great Head Gardener smiled, so that the jungle all
over his face moved like a cornfield in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope so, Missie,&amp;quot; he growled affectionately. And I
hope,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;to go and see my old mother. She lives
in London too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, where, Basseker?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Over Elephant and Castle way, Missie — if I can get
there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Lady Rose's eyes grew bigger. The name, which
she had never heard before, enchanted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does she live in a castle? And has she got an elephant?&amp;quot;
she asked breathlessly. &amp;quot;But how — &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt;, Basseker!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jungle waved about again as the big fellow smiled.
He hardly knew what to say at first, it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wonderful, Missie, indeed she is. She's ninety
four this coming June.&amp;quot; He hesitated a moment. If his
lordship'd allow it — I'd like to show her to you. The sight
of you, Missie, would do her a power o' good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose stared up into the great bushy face. Her mind was
working rapidly. Whether her father allowed it or not, she
decided to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It might make her grow, you mean?&amp;quot; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's no knowing Missie,&amp;quot; rumbled the invisible
mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how do you get there? Is it far?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazing down into the little upturned face, he told her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground, Missie — that's the way I generally go.&amp;quot;
The deep voice boomed, the tangled hair moved again in
rippling waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Oh!&amp;quot; cried Lady Rose, her eyes bigger than ever,
her excitement too great for a hundred questions she burned
to ask. And before she could find her voice again, Basseker
had moved away. &amp;quot;I must be getting along,&amp;quot; he explained,
&amp;quot;or my things'll forget to grow.&amp;quot; He placed a great earth-stained
finger against the jungle that hid his lips to enjoin
secrecy, and a moment later had disappeared among the
lilac trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Elephant &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Castle!&amp;quot; she repeated under her breath,
too thrilled to do more than whisper. &amp;quot;And he goes underground
to get there! Elephant … Castle … Underground …!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words ran singing in her mind for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a month later, June blazing in the sky, when from
an upper landing she caught sight of Basseker far below
among the passages of the great London mansion. He looked
the same as usual, except that he wore a white collar and rather
tidy clothes. Even before she saw him the scent of apples
and potting-sheds had reached her nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bed-time hour had come, but Lady Rose was too
excited to lie in bed waiting for her mother. She had crept
out in her red dressing-gown to have a peep. For there was
a big Dinner Party and Ball that night, and the house was
in commotion. Basseker, she realised, had brought up the
flowers for the decorations. He was frightfully busy, of course,
far too busy for her to get a word with him. Besides, he
could not even see her on that high upper landing. But
other people were busy too, far too busy to pay her attention
as usual. Parents, servants, nurses, all were in something
of a flutter, seeing to the last details of the great Entertainment
to which hundreds of people were coming. Rose, to her
keen joy, was neglected rather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother came rustling along the passage at length,
breathless, her eyes shining, and kissed her good-night as
usual, then tucked her up in bed and left the room, closing
the door softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Rosie, get to sleep quickly,&amp;quot; was her last remark,
&amp;quot;and I'll tell you all about it in the morning,&amp;quot; as the child
snuggled down among the sheets. She heard her mother's
silken skirts go swishing down the corridor, then die away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house grew still, the darkness covered her, the excitement
from the lower floors of the big house did not penetrate
to this upper region where the Night Nursery was. Little
Lady Rose closed her eyes, drew the blankets up to her cheek,
and prepared to fall asleep. Through the window, open at
the top, stole in the sweet night air of June. Her breathing
became slow, deep, regular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the sweet June air, it seemed, something else presently
came stealing in — a faint scent of ripe apples, of bast, of potting-sheds,
of earth. It was a delicate, delicious mixture,
very fragrant. Her dream shifted queerly towards Basseker,
the great Head Gardener. It began to play with him, the
giant figure that made things grow. She saw his bushy beard,
his kindly face, his slow, swaying walk; she heard his deep,
earthquakey voice. She realised adventure was about. Ideas
of a mighty elephant, a towering castle, shot past her. They
were underground somewhere. She was hunting for them,
hunting for the way. She could not find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sound like wind rustling in the branches of a tree was
wafted across the still darkness of the room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you ready, Missie?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes. She stared. She listened. Against
the window, where the faint light of the stars peeped in, she
saw the outline of broad shoulders and a great bushy head.
She recognised the massive bulk of Basseker. He was right
inside the room, not ten feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Basseker …!&amp;quot; she whispered, now wide awake, unable
to believe her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Time we were off, Missie,&amp;quot; came the deep whispered
answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose sprang out of bed. In a second she was in
her red dressing-gown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're going --?&amp;quot; she squeezed out in a breathless
whisper, too excited to manage more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With you,&amp;quot; rolled the boom of his quiet voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; she squeaked, feverishly thrusting a foot into the
sleeve of her dressing-gown in her amazement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's close on midnight,&amp;quot; he growled. Time to start!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it naughty, she asked herself? Was it being disobedient?
The temptation was irresistible. She was always
allowed to go with Basseker, she told herself. Always!
Anywhere! But, actually, she thought of only one thing --
how was she to manage it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I shall be seen, shan't I?&amp;quot; she asked tremblingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker moved up closer in the semi-darkness. It was
like a dim tree moving. &amp;quot;Get into this,&amp;quot; he said, and she
saw a big potato sack held wide open by his great brown
hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sack was clean and looked inviting. It smelt sweet.
She did not hesitate now. Scrambling feet first, she slipped
into its wide mouth, and the next minute felt herself swung
across the broad shoulders, dangling helplessly down his
back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the room and along the passages they went smoothly,
but down the back stairs was rather a bumpy business, and
Basseker had big bones in his shoulders that stuck into her
ribs. She lay curled up, head uppermost, of course, arms
tight against her sides, and she tried to look like a load of
potatoes as much as possible. The way Basseker strode along
gave her confidence. They passed the pantry and kitchen,
and the voices of the busy servants were audible. But no
one stopped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Going home, are you, Mr. Basseker?&amp;quot; she heard the
cook say with a yawn. &amp;quot;Off to see your mother, I suppose?
A big bundle you've got this time. Extra heavy it looks!
Something for the old lady, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Growing things,&amp;quot; replied Basseker, without stopping.
&amp;quot;They do weigh a bit, yes.&amp;quot; He strode on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose could feel the vibrations of his rumbling voice down
his spine. The cook called good-night, he answered her with
a grunt, and a moment later he had opened the service door
and was out in the street. She felt the cooler air, as he lowered
the big sack gently to the ground, peeped in to see if she were
all right, then hoisted her on to his shoulders again in a more
comfortable position. &amp;quot;We've got a bit yet to go,&amp;quot; he explained
gently, &amp;quot;and there are still a lot of people about.
I've made a hole for you to see through. Hold tight now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off they went again along the still busy pavements. Rose
could see the people streaming past, but they could not see
her. To them she seemed just a sack of potatoes. Policemen
eyed the bundle rather closely once or twice, but Basseker
looked too innocent for them to stop him and ask what he
had inside his sack; he looked just what he was — a Head
Gardener who had come up from the country. Meanwhile,
they had covered a mile or so, the streets were emptier, she
heard Big Ben strike the hour. She counted the strokes.
Basseker was counting them too.&amp;quot;One, two, three …
she could feel the sound rumbling down his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Twelve!&amp;quot; he said aloud, when the clock had finished,
&amp;quot;and here we are at last! Now,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;we go below.
You'll like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, Missie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground?&amp;quot; she piped, bursting with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;But I mustn't let you out
till we get there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the hole in the sack Rose could see an enormous
gateway, a sort of high arched portal, brilliantly lit, with
people streaming through it into the street. They had white
faces, they looked tired, they were evidently hurrying home
to bed. The last one had passed them and the great hall
was empty, when Basseker's legs suddenly stopped moving
He no longer walked; his body kept quite still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Down we go,&amp;quot; he said in a thick whisper, &amp;quot;down, down,
down!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they began to sink. Sliding, sliding down into the
earth they went. It was a steady, easy motion, like sinking
into deep water. A low rumbling sound accompanied them,
but no voices, no footsteps. They were now alone. Rose
held her breath. She knew she was dropping through space,
and she began to wonder how much deeper they were going
to fall, when suddenly she heard Basseker's growling voice.
He was saying something to himself: &amp;quot;Step off with the right
foot,&amp;quot;  she heard. And the same instant she felt his leg move
forward with a jerk. They were on the level again. The
sinking was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Missie, I can let you out,&amp;quot; he said with a deep
sigh of relief, and opened the mouth of the sack. &amp;quot;And I
hope you haven't got the cramp or tied yourself into knots!&amp;quot;
He laughed, and the sound of his laughter went echoing away
into vast empty spaces beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose climbed out, straightened herself, rubbed her
eyes, and told him she was all right. She had not got cramp,
and she was not tied in a knot. She looked about her. She
understood at once why his voice had echoed, for she saw
great tunnels running in every direction. Their black gaping
mouths were all round her, and a queer, deep rumbling
murmur came out of them as from very far away. It rose
and fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the elephants breathing?&amp;quot; she asked. She
wondered for a moment whether it was his old mother, but
she didn't like to say it. She was not a bit frightened. No
one could ever be frightened with Basseker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's just the echoes from the world above,&amp;quot; he explained
with a grin she thought wonderful. &amp;quot;But we're all
alone down here. It's after midnight, and there's no one
about. We've got a long way to go yet, and had better be
moving.&amp;quot; He took her by the hand and went up to a large iron
gateway above which was written in capital letters &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;No Exit.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She read this with an effort: &lt;em&gt;No Exit&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;That means we
mayn't go in, doesn't it?&amp;quot; she asked, still holding firmly to
his huge brown hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker studied it too, as though it were the label of one
of his rock-garden plants. &amp;quot;It means,&amp;quot; he replied at length,
&amp;quot;that most people mayn't go in, go out, rather, I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; say.
But &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; — he dropped her hand and made a wide gesture
with his arms — &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he went on proudly, &amp;quot;can go anywhere!
It's after midnight, and I'm going to see my mother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose stared up into his face. The hair, she thought, had
grown much longer. He was the bushiest thing she had
ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she as old as &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot; she asked, for age, to her, meant
having peculiar privileges. &amp;quot;And does she ride on the elephant
into her very own castle?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker made no direct reply to this. His beard rippled
with his laughter. How white his collar was! How his
voice boomed and echoed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All this Underground,&amp;quot; he remarked, &amp;quot;belongs to us --
till four o'clock in the morning. We can go where we like.
There's not a living soul to stop us. We're underneath the
whole of London town. Come on, let's get a-going!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grabbed her hand again. He whistled. The great
iron gate flew open. They shot through like a couple of
projectiles from the muzzle of some enormous gun. And
Rose found herself standing at the entrance to an immense
tunnel that gaped into black space before her. At her feet
she saw two gleaming metal rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There we are, Missie!&amp;quot; cried Basseker. &amp;quot;And this is
how we go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stooped down and did something to his boots, and then
placed one foot on each shining rail. The next minute he
was doing the same thing to her own feet, whatever it was.
He straightened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Missie, can you keep your balance? We go
pretty fast, remember.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He straddled like a giraffe when it lowers itself to drink.
Her own feet were placed like his own, one on each rail, so
that she, too, straddled, wide enough for someone to have
shot between her legs. She drew a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I shan't split, shall I?&amp;quot; she cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No fear, Missie, but you'll go like greased lightning.
Now, take my hand. It's a long way to the Elephant and
Castle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She just had time to snatch his hand when they were off.
Her feet, one glued to each rail, began to move. Basseker
shot forward, sliding as if he were on skates. She followed
him, half dragged, half gliding by her own weight. It seemed
like going downhill. They fairly flew. But her feet kept
easily to the rails, which were as smooth as ice or butter.
The dark walls of the tunnel flashed past her, the air rushed
into her face, she was aware of Basseker's beard streaming
past her like a river. Her eyes began to water, she couldn't
get her breath, her red dressing gown flew out on both sides
like a flag in the wind. They raced along like lightning
But she never felt her balance waver. She kept steady,
leaning a little forward in her effort to keep hold of Basseker's
hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! Whirr!&amp;quot; she screamed with delight. &amp;quot;I'm
flying, flying!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quicker than growing, ain't it, Missie,&amp;quot; shouted Basseker,
and his voice seemed to drop a mile behind him into space
before the words were properly out. If flowers grew as fast
as this, she thought, they would be up in a night. Yet sometimes
they did come up in a single night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this where all the roots are?&amp;quot; she tried to ask. &amp;quot;Are
we underground where the flowers begin to grow? Is your
mother growing underground? And where's the Elephant?
Where's the Castle?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the wind caught her tiny voice and whipped it into
space behind them before he could catch a single syllable.
Her hair was plastered across her mouth, and when she tried
to brush it away the sleeve of her dressing-gown was almost
torn from its seams. Her hand and arm, she even thought,
would be swept away with it. They flew along at a terrific
speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, the darkness lifted, and she saw a round
circle of bright light ahead. It seemed miles away. It grew
larger and larger. It was white and silvery. They were
rushing towards it. Every second it became bigger. And
she knew what it was. It was the mouth of the tunnel. They
were coming out of the black darkness into the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second later they were out, and the brilliance was so
dazzling that at first Rose could only shade her eyes and
blink. &amp;quot;Well done, Missie,&amp;quot; she heard Basseker's booming
voice. &amp;quot;You're a first-rate Slider. You're as good under
ground as I am, and I've been at it for years!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot; she asked, recovering her breath while
he stooped to lift her feet from the slippery rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground,&amp;quot; he replied, &amp;quot;and in the Castle gardens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then where does the light come from? Why isn't it
dark?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed and stood up straight. &amp;quot;Because the sunshine
that falls on the ground all day sinks through,&amp;quot;  he explained.
&amp;quot;It isn't lost. It slips down here between the earth
and rocks and gets into the growing things before they show
up above us in the air.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And your mother, Basseker? And the Castle? And
the Elephant?&amp;quot; she asked, still panting from the recent headlong
rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just look!&amp;quot; he told her. &amp;quot;Open your eyes, Missie, and
look!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did so, for she was now accustomed to the light,
which no longer dazzled her. All about her, as far as the eye
could reach, lay a stretch of park-like garden, basking in warm
sunshine, and covered with flowers in their wild state, from
snowdrops and violets to anemones, sweet williams, daffodils,
lilies and crocuses. There were thousands of them, spring,
summer and autumn flowers, all growing at once. Fruit
trees filled the air with blossom, lilac and laburnum hung in
falling waves, honeysuckle and wild roses starred the landscape
everywhere. And through these, rising into the still,
bright air, stood up in the distance the turrets and spires of
a magnificent castle, its grey walls gleaming, its roofs and
windows gleaming like silver against the sky. From a pole
at the very top a coloured flag streamed gaily in the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose caught her breath. &amp;quot;Oh Basseker!&amp;quot; she
cried, &amp;quot;what a lovely, lovely place!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course it is,&amp;quot; he growled. &amp;quot;You wouldn't expect
flowers to come from a place that wasn't lovely! Would
you now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before she could answer a curious deep sound broke
in upon the silence. Thud — thud — thud, it came. It was
followed by a trumpeting noise she had never heard before.
Nearer and nearer came the thuds; the ground seemed to
tremble; something was thumping down towards them through
the orchard, and when she turned to look she saw a gigantic
shape that was higher than the trees moving slowly in their
direction. It was quite close already, not fifty yards away
It was coming straight at her, it seemed, and she ran up to
Basseker and hid her face in his coat. It was an elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There, there, Missie,&amp;quot; he laughed in his deepest
tones, so that she could feel the sound vibrating against his
waistcoat, &amp;quot;there's nothing to be afraid of. It's only Beauty
coming to take us up to the Castle where my mother lives!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She peeped. The monster had come to a stop beside
them and was flapping his huge ears. His eyes looked down
at her. The same minute he lowered his enormous bulk
towards the ground, his trunk swept out till its end almost
touched her hand as though it waited for a bun, and the tiny
tail at the other end of the immense body began to tweak
this way and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He likes you, Missie. He's offering you a seat on his
back. He'll carry us both. Just put your foot in his trunk
and he'll lift you up as easy as rolling into bed!&amp;quot; He laughed
and pointed and Rose saw that the end of the trunk was
curved like the letter U. Her fear had suddenly left her, for
she felt that the great beast was as kind and gentle as he was
big. Slowly lifting her foot, she placed it in the curve of the
trunk, grabbed at the rough, thick skin with both hands, and
the next instant was hoisted through the air and set down
on the broad back as delicately as a leaf falls to the ground
in autumn. A moment later Basseker was similarly raised
and dropped close behind her so that he could hold her with
both his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this in itself was exciting enough to take all the
attention she had, but there was something else she had
noticed that excited her almost more — and that was that her
foot as she had placed it in the curved trunk, no longer
wore the bedroom slipper she had left the house with, but
was now of shining yellow. It was a golden slipper. On
the left foot was another golden slipper exactly like it, and
her red dressing-gown had completely changed as well. It
was now a golden dress, shining with the gold of laburnum,
buttercups and dandelions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Basseker!&amp;quot; she cried. &amp;quot;I've changed to gold! I'm
dressed in gold! When did it happen?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I'm in silver,&amp;quot; he replied with a deep chuckle.
&amp;quot;It happened in the tunnel. The speed did that. We've
got to be lovely too, everything's got to be lovely here.&amp;quot; And
she now realized for the first time that he wore silver from
head to foot and a silver plume waved on his head, so that
he looked like a knight in a fairy tale rather than a Head
Gardener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hoop-la, Beauty! Off we go!&amp;quot; he boomed, and the
elephant began to move ponderously up the slope between
the crowding fruit trees. It swayed from side to side, but
it went carefully forward, as though remembering that it
carried a precious load. There was never any danger of the
riders slipping off. And its huge feet, Rose noticed, avoided
stepping on the flowers, as it picked its way as delicately as
a skater doing tricks between standing bottles that must not
be knocked over. Below her spread the tops of the fruit
trees with their sea of blossoms. Yet some of these trees,
to her surprise, bore fruit instead of blossoms. Everything
seemed to grow at once in this marvellous great garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; she cried, &amp;quot;there's a lovely pear, all ripe and
juicy! How I should like to eat it!&amp;quot; And, hardly had the
words left her lips, when the long flexible trunk had plucked
the fruit from the bough and, curling backwards over the
broad flat head, was offering it to her. She took it, a little
cautiously, exclaimed &amp;quot;Oh, thank you, Beauty!&amp;quot; and handed
it to Basseker. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; have it, please,&amp;quot; she said, holding it
out to him over her shoulder. But the elephant was quicker
than she was; already the trunk had picked another for
Basseker too, and was poking it into his mouth. Grapes,
oranges, cherries, and even strawberries were fed to them in
this way as the monster slowly climbed the slope towards
the Castle, but when Rose saw some lilies and asked if she
might have these too, the huge beast did not move his trunk
to pick them. Instead, the giant head wagged slowly to and
fro and from side to side, though too gently to upset the
balance of his riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He's shaking his head!&amp;quot; cried Rose. &amp;quot;Does that mean
I can't have the lilies?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He never picks flowers,&amp;quot; explained Basseker. &amp;quot;He
won't touch growing things, Missie. Why, he doesn't even
step on them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, they emerged from the orchard and the
trees were behind them. A bright green lawn, smooth as
a billiard table and creamy with a million white daisies
stretched in front, with a gravel path that looked like brown
sugar winding up to the castle walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great Castle now faced them, the biggest she had
ever seen; there seemed countless windows, and that meant
countless rooms behind them. The light grey stone of which
it was built gave it a silvery appearance. It was far, far too
big for one person to occupy; Rose decided that no one person
could possibly need so many rooms. Basseker's old mother
could hardly use them all. Her mind became so full of
questions that she could not frame a single one at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quite right, Missie,&amp;quot; growled the deep voice against her
neck, for he evidently had read her thoughts,&amp;quot; there's only
one living-room. The others are kept — oh, for all sorts of
things. You'll see presently for yourself. But first you must
be introduced to my mother. She's expecting you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we get in? There's no door. Not a single
door anywhere!&amp;quot; Rose gasped. She had been searching for
a door, but could not find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right again, Missie,&amp;quot; said Basseker with a grin. All
in good time. Now, Beauty,&amp;quot; he addressed the elephant,
&amp;quot;just stand still a minute, then ring the bell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monster stopped; he was close against the walls;
and the same instant he raised his trunk in the air and let out
a trumpeting that might have been heard a mile away. Three
times he trumpeted, then turned his little eyes upwards in
the direction of the second storey. Basseker glanced up too,
and Rose did the same. A moment passed, but only a moment,
for almost immediately a window on the second floor was
flung wide open, and the face and figure of a little old woman
was seen looking out and down at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here we are,&amp;quot; boomed Basseker. &amp;quot;We've both come,
you see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face broke into smiles, and two hands were stretched
out far above them over the window-ledge. &amp;quot;Welcome to
your little ladyship,&amp;quot; exclaimed a gentle voice, &amp;quot;and will you
please come inside and see me?&amp;quot; She waved her hands she
beckoned. &amp;quot;I've such a lot to show you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I'd like to,&amp;quot; called Rose, &amp;quot;but how can I get up
to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's quite easy,&amp;quot; replied the gentle voice, and before
anyone could say another word, the elephant had twined his
long trunk about her waist and lifted her high in the air
towards the window. A second later she was across the ledge
and safely in the old woman's arms, and the smiling old face
which, Rose thought, was like a ripe, wrinkled apple in the
sun, had kissed her. Dressed in purple silk, her bright eyes
sparkling, a white sun-bonnet about the head, smelling like
a lily too, Rose thought of her as a wild iris growing on some
river bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; she exclaimed, as she returned the kiss, &amp;quot;I believe
you really are a flower! And thank you for inviting me.
And are you really going to show me all sorts of things? And
do you live alone in the Castle? And — and&amp;quot; — she looked
about her — &amp;quot;where's &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; — your son, I mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a gleam of something silvery flashing through
the open window, a thud on the floor, and Basseker, lifted by
the trunk, stood beside them. The little old woman in purple,
Basseker in silver, and Rose in gold — it was a picture straight
out of fairyland. And when Basseker lifted his mother in
his arms and kissed her, Rose thought of some Knight in her
storybooks at home rescuing an imprisoned Princess from
the Ogre's tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything growing nicely, is it?&amp;quot; Basseker asked, and
the old woman, smiling down at Rose, said: &amp;quot;Yes, everything,
including &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; as she stroked the child's hair. &amp;quot;Just
like her name, too, isn't she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; growled her son, &amp;quot;and she loves a garden
as much as we do; that's why I brought her. Now, there
isn't too much time, mother. We must get back before dawn,
remember. You'd better show her about at once. There's
lots to see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started off through the great Castle, going from
room to room, down endless corridors, along winding galleries,
up and down staircases, and through enormous halls. &amp;quot;We
get everything ready here, you see,&amp;quot;  explained the old woman,
&amp;quot;for sending up above, where you see them coming out of
the earth as flowers and shrubs and trees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one great room lay thousands of bulbs of various sorts,
in another the floor was several feet deep in seeds, a third
was full of cuttings, buds, and little sprays for grafting. One
very large hall held nothing but fruit, another roots and
vegetables, a third sweet-smelling herbs, a fourth flowering
trees and shrubs such as lilac, laburnum, lavender and sweet-briar.
Some rooms were cool and others hot, according to
what they contained, and the galleries were laid down with
different kinds of earth and soil, a foot deep, while the lower
floors were given over to mosses, ferns, and the kind of growing
things that needed damp, spongy ground. Across the ground
floor, running the whole length of the Castle, was a little
tinkling stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The bees and the birds, mother,&amp;quot; came Basseker's deep
voice. &amp;quot;Don't forget to show her those. Time's getting on,
too. We mustn't linger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They climbed a long, winding staircase that went up into
one of the lofty towers, on each landing of which there was
one very large room, and as they neared the first a deep murmuring
sound was audible inside. The door had a sheet of
glass let into it like a window. Basseker put his face against
it and looked through, but did not open the door. The murmuring
rose and fell like the sound of surf a long way off.
Rose hesitated, as he drew back to let her see, for the curious
noise rather frightened her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing to hurt you, Missie,&amp;quot; he told her. &amp;quot;They
won't touch you, because they can't. Just have a peep
through the glass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She put her face against the pane and stared and it was
indeed a queer sight she saw. The air was alive with movement --
thousands of little objects circled through it in all
directions, in streams and lines and clusters. They were
flying things, but at first she could not guess what they were.
The windows were wide open, the room was full of sunlight,
and flowers of all sorts, she saw, grew on the floor, hung from
the ceiling, and even clung to the walls. The little flying
objects circled about everywhere but especially near the
flowers, and while hundreds kept going through the window
into the open air, hundreds more flew in to take their places,
Rose started and stared, wondering what it all meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bees, Missie,&amp;quot; Basseker's deep voice explained behind
her. &amp;quot;They're practising collecting pollen while they suck
the honey, so that they can spread it from flower to flower
when they get above ground again. There are millions of
them in that big room!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next landing, close under the very roof of the
tower, were the birds, and Rose found it even more wonderful
than the bee room. For here she saw the birds — thrushes,
blackbirds, swallows, finches, tits — learning which flies and
grubs and insects injured the growing plants, and which,
therefore, they must eat so that the plants could have a chance
to grow. She was so fascinated that old Mrs. Basseker had
to drag her away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as they wandered from room to room, the
time was passing, and presently a loud trumpeting from the
elephant outside warned them that they must hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oho!&amp;quot; cried Basseker, &amp;quot;that means the dawn is coming
We must be getting back, mother. The Underground is only
empty till four o'clock, remember. Beauty's giving us a hint!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But we haven't had tea yet,&amp;quot; complained the old woman,
&amp;quot;and there's strawberry jam and meringues and gooseberry-fool
and trifle and a dozen other things her ladyship likes.
Besides, there are the water-plants to show her still, the magic
sunflowers, the lotus buds, and — oh, a hundred more. And
the weeds — we haven't shown her how we kill the awful
weeds — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another time, mother; another time!&amp;quot; cried Basseker.
&amp;quot;She mustn't be late. After four o'clock the Tubes are full
of trains and people. Besides, I've got to get her up to her
room again safely. And then I must get back to the home
gardens myself!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant kept on trumpeting, and Basseker and his
mother kept on talking both at once. But the time had come;
they had to go. They could not risk being caught by the
trains and the people in the network of tunnels and tubes
beneath old London town. Basseker knew his business.
That's why he was such a marvellous Head Gardener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Father told me you were born underground,&amp;quot;  piped
Rose breathlessly, as he took her by the hand and pulled her
downstairs, across the halls and galleries to the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodbye, your ladyship, and please come again!&amp;quot; cried
the old mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trunk poked its end through the window into the
room. It went curving and wriggling about, searching for
its human luggage. It found Rose's little waist and fastened
itself round it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodbye, Mrs. Basseker, goodbye!&amp;quot; she cried as she
was caught and whisked through the window. She landed
gently on the broad back. Next, Basseker followed her
through the air and sat behind her. The old woman smiled
and waved her purple arms. They started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're a bit late, Beauty,&amp;quot; Basseker said, and the monster
understood and went swiftly down the gravel path and through
the fruit trees till they reached the tunnel mouth. &amp;quot;We're
very late,&amp;quot; boomed Basseker. &amp;quot;I doubt if we shall do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For answer the elephant, having reached the opening,
stooped, placed his enormous feet carefully on the rails, and
suddenly — shot inside with both riders still upon his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well done, Beauty!&amp;quot; cried Basseker. You're a wonderful
fellow!&amp;quot; He turned Rose's face towards him and added:
&amp;quot;He goes twice as fast as we can!&amp;quot; They were off. &amp;quot;Hold
tight!&amp;quot; he bawled. &amp;quot;I've got you! Keep your face down!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shot away like lightning. The wind roared past
them. The elephant's body almost filled the tunnel, but he
never wavered, his great feet held safely to the slippery rails.
Occasionally his long trunk came backwards over his shoulders
to feel if his riders were safe. The monster shot like a meteor
racing through the sky. It was a marvellous performance.
Then, gradually, his speed slackened; a round hole of light
appeared beyond his flapping ears; the end of the tunnel was
in sight. They reached the station. Already the electric
lights were turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We've just time!&amp;quot; called Basseker breathlessly, as the
trunk lifted them both down in turn. &amp;quot;Goodbye, Beauty!
And we can't thank you enough. Without your help we
should never have got here in time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant turned round with his head pointing into the
tunnel again; he flapped his ears, his small eyes peeped at
the two passengers, his trunk came wriggling round and touched
Rose's hand to say goodbye, and the next second — he was
off. His huge bulk, looking like a great haystack, slid into
the big black mouth of the Tube, and he shot away like an
arrow. He was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose waved her hand and cried &amp;quot;Goodbye, goodbye!&amp;quot;
when Basseker interrupted her. He no longer wore silvery
clothes, her own red dressing-gown had come back too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not a minute to spare,&amp;quot; he whispered. &amp;quot;I hear voices.
The ticket-collectors and conductors are coming back to
work already. The trains will start any minute now. Hop
in, Missie, hop in!&amp;quot; He held the sack open for her; she
stepped inside; the next instant she was swung across his
back again and he had begun to take his long, steady strides
across the platforms. She curled up as best she could, closed
her eyes, and tried to think of all the wonderful things she
had seen and heard. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it was a queer fact, but natural, perhaps, that she
felt drowsy suddenly. The swing of Basseker's long stride
was soothing. He moved easily and gently. She remembered
when the gliding began -- uphill this time, instead of down --
but, oddly enough, she did not notice when it stopped.
&amp;quot;Right foot … step off with the right …&amp;quot; she heard his
deep rumble as he spoke to himself, but the actual instant
when he left the sliding staircase and crossed the level platform
into the street made no impression on her. Once or
twice she heard him say &amp;quot;Good-morning! Fine day again!&amp;quot;
evidently to someone, a policeman, perhaps, whom he passed
in the still empty streets, but beyond that she remembered
nothing until she was aware that he was climbing slowly and
stealthily up a long series of steps. She knew then that they
were in the house again. Suddenly he stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here we are, Missie,&amp;quot; he whispered. She heard a
handle rattle. He was opening a door. She felt him walk
in. She heard the door closed behind them. Then she felt
him carefully lowering the heavy sack from his shoulders.
The cool air touched her face. It was light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes in her own bedroom, where the dawn
was creeping in through the open window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One, two, three!&amp;quot; whispered Basseker, and with a
gentle heave he dumped her out of the mouth of the sack and
into her own bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood there a minute looking down at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh please take me again some day, Basseker,&amp;quot; she
whispered breathlessly, &amp;quot;please, please. I loved it so.…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He whispered back, as he pulled the bedclothes up to her
chin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another time, Missie, I will. There's lots more to see
besides the Elephant and Castle — there's the Black Friars, the
Cross King, the Swiss Cottage, the Court of the Baron and
the Raven, the Seven Sisters with their Seven Dials, the old
Parson of the Green, the Three Circuses … and … and
now I must be off to catch my train to the country and see
how my things — &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; things — are growing.…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was gone. The house was very still. The servants
all lay asleep. The dawn grew brighter. Lady Rose closed
her eyes and promptly fell sound asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If seeing is believing the story, of course, is justified, and stands
foursquare as a fact, for certainly both my cousin and myself saw
the thing as clearly as we saw the village church and the wooded
mountains beyond, which were its background. There may, how-
ever, be other explanations, and my cousin, who is something of
a psychologist, availed himself volubly of the occasion to ride his
pet hobby. He easily riddled the saying that seeing is believing,
while I listened as patiently as possible. Although no psychologist
myself, I knew that the phrase was as inadequate as most other
generalisations. Indeed, there is no commoner act of magic in
daily life than that of sight, by which the mind projects into the
air an image, translated objectively from a sensation in the brain
caused by light irritating the optic nerve. &amp;quot;The picture on the
retina, upside down, anyhow,&amp;quot; he kept telling me afterwards, &amp;quot;is
not the object itself that throws off the light-rays, is it? You never
see the actual object, do you? You're merely playing with an
image, eh? It's pure image-ination, don't you see? It's simple
magic, the magic that everybody denies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, somehow, nothing he could offer by way of explanation
satisfied me. The question form of his sentences, moreover, irritated.
I rather clung to &amp;quot;seeing is believing,&amp;quot; and I think in his
heart he did the same, for all his cloud of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was evening, and the summer dusk was falling, as we
tramped in silence up the hill towards the village where my cousin,
with his wife and children, occupy the upper part of an old chalet.
We had been climbing Jura cliffs all day; it had been arduous,
exciting work, and we both were tired out. Conversation had long
since ceased; our legs moved mechanically, and we both devoutly
wished we were at home. &amp;quot;Ah, there's the cemetery at last,&amp;quot; he
sighed, as the landmark near the village came into view. &amp;quot;Thank
goodness!&amp;quot; and I was too weary even to make the obvious commentary.
The relief of lying down seemed in his mind. With a
grunt by way of reply I glanced carelessly at the rough stone-wall
surrounding the ugly patch cut squarely from the vineyards, and at
the formal pines and larches that stood, plume-like, among the
pleasant graves. &amp;quot;Old mère Corbillard is safe and snug in her
last resting-place,&amp;quot; he added, as we passed the painted iron-gate,
&amp;quot;and a good thing too!&amp;quot; There was relief in his tone, but a
moment later there was vivid annoyance. &amp;quot;Izzie,&amp;quot; he cried,
stopping short, &amp;quot;what are you doing again in there? You know
your mother forbade you to go any more. What a naughty, disobedient
child you are!&amp;quot; And he called to his fourteen-year-old
child to come out. She came at once, but listlessly, and not one
whit afraid. He scolded her a little. &amp;quot;I was only putting flowers
on the grave,&amp;quot; she said. Her face wore a puzzled, scared expression,
and the eyes were very bright — she had wonderful brown
eyes — but it was not her father's chiding that caused the look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took our arms with affectionate possession, as her way was,
and we all three laboured up the hill together. No more was said: her
father was too tired to find further fault. &amp;quot;Please don't tell
mother, Daddy, will you?&amp;quot; she whispered, as we reached the chalet
and went in; &amp;quot;I promise faithfully not to go again.&amp;quot; He said
nothing, but I saw him give her a kiss, and I gave her one myself.
The feeling was strong in me that she was frightened and needed
protection. I put my arm tightly round her, giving her a good
warm hug. The pleading, helpless look she gave me in return
I shall not soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory of &amp;quot;old mère Corbillard&amp;quot; no one cared to keep
alive — the wealthy peasant who had died a week ago. Known as
&amp;quot;la mauvaise riche,&amp;quot; because of her miserly habits, she was also
credited with stealing her neighbours' cats for the purpose of devouring
them — &amp;quot;lapin de montagne,&amp;quot; as the natives termed the
horrid dish. Her face was sinister — steel-grey eyes, hooked nose,
and prominent teeth — and had the village soul been more imaginative
or superstitious, she would certainly have been called a witch.
As it was, she merely passed for &amp;quot;méchante&amp;quot; and distinctly
&amp;quot;toquée.&amp;quot; Held in general disfavour, she was avoided and disliked,
and she repaid the hatred well, thanks to her money. She
lived in utter solitude, the one companion, oddly enough, to whom
admittance was never denied, being — Izzie. &amp;quot;Oddly enough,&amp;quot; because,
while the old woman was half-imbecile, maliciously imbecile,
the child, on her side — to put it kindly — was unusually backward
for her age, if not mentally deficient. But Izzie's deficiency
was of mild and gentle quality — a sweet child, if ever there was
one. And the parents, while barely tolerating the strange acquaintanceship,
never knew how frequent the visits were. They always
meant to stop the friendship, yet had never done so. Izzie, true
solitary, kept to herself too much. She loved the old woman's
stories. They hesitated to say the final No. Thus, at first, they
let her go to put fresh flowers, which she picked herself, upon the
grave, until, feeling that her too constant journeys there were
morbid, the ultimatum had gone forth that they must stop. &amp;quot;It's
queer that you should care to go so often,&amp;quot; said her father. &amp;quot;It's
not right,&amp;quot; added her mother, the parents exchanging a look that
meant they scented some unholy influence at work. &amp;quot;But I promised
to do it every day,&amp;quot; said Izzie frankly. Then further explanations
elicited the unwelcome addition: &amp;quot;She said she would
come and fetch me if I didn't&amp;quot; — and the influence of the old
woman seemed defined. &amp;quot;Ha, ha!&amp;quot; said mother's eyes to father;
&amp;quot;so the old wretch frightened her apparently into the promise,&amp;quot;
and they congratulated themselves that the mischief had been
stopped in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident was slight enough. The imagination of the backward
child, perhaps a little morbidly inclined owing to her love of
solitude, had been unduly stimulated. It had been gently, wisely
corrected, and the matter was at an end. Yet, somehow, for me,
it lingered in my memory, as though something very vital lay at
the core of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There followed forty-eight hours of soaking rain that kept us
all indoors, and after it a day of cloudless sunshine that made
everybody happy. We romped and played with the children, basked
in the delicious heat, and were generally full of active mischief.
Mother, mending stockings and trying to write letters, had a merry
time of it. But joy and forgiveness ruled the day, and one was
ashamed to feel vexation at anything with such a sun in the
heavens. Only Izzie, I noticed, kept apart; she was listless and indifferent,
joining in no games; her thin, pale face, in contrast to the
strange brilliance of her eyes, was evidence to me of some force
busily at work within. But she kept it fairly well concealed; it
seemed natural for her to moon about alone; I think no one else
noticed that her behaviour was more marked than usual. With the
cunning of the slow-witted she avoided me in particular, guessing
that I was ready to make advances. She divined that I understood.
Hiding my purpose as well as possible, I kept her closely under
observation, and after supper, when she strolled off alone down the
road between the vineyards, I called to Daddy to come and have a
pipe. We followed her. The moment we caught her up she turned
and took her place as usual, an arm to each. How tall she seemed;
she almost topped her father. She kept silence, merely walking in
step with us, and holding us rather close I thought, as though glad
of our presence though she had started off alone. At first
Daddy made efforts to draw her into conversation — efforts that
failed utterly. For my part, I let her be, content to keep her arm
firmly in my own, for there was very strong in me the feeling that I
must protect and watch, guarding her from something that she
feared yet was unable to resist. We talked across her, I guiding
the conversation towards fun, and she was so tall that we had to
stoop and lean forward to see each other's faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot sun had dried the road up, and the evening was still and
peaceful. We paced slowly to and fro, turning always at the village
fountain, and again at the crest of the hill where the descent
went steeply towards the cemetery. And here, at each turning
Izzie lingered a moment and looked down the hill. I felt perceptibly
the dragging on my arm. Once, at the fountain, I made to follow
the road through the village. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; said the child, with decision
I disliked intensely. &amp;quot;let's go back again,&amp;quot; and we obeyed meekly.
&amp;quot;Little tyrant,&amp;quot; said her unobservant father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountains rose in a wall of purple shadow, their ridges
outlined against a fading sky of gold and crimson. Thin columns
of peat smoke traced their scaffolding across it faintly, then melted
out. From time to time a group of labourers from the vineyards
passed us, singing the Dalcroze songs, taking their hats off, and
saying &amp;quot;Bon soir, bonne nuit.&amp;quot; We knew them all. Izzie
watched them go — with almost feverish interest. I got the queer
impression she was waiting till the last group had gone home. She
certainly was waiting for something; there was a covert expectancy
in her manner that stirred my former uneasiness. And this uneasiness
grew stronger every minute. I could hardly listen to my
cousin's desultory talk. At last I brought things suddenly to a
head, for it was more than my nerves could stand. Abruptly I
stood still. The other two, linked arm-in-arm stood with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy,&amp;quot; I said sharply, &amp;quot;let's go in,&amp;quot; and was going to add
peremptorily, &amp;quot;Take Izzie with you,&amp;quot; when the words died away on
my lips and the tongue in my mouth went dry. My blood seemed
turned to ice. For a second I stood in rigid paralysis. For the
figure between us, she whose arms were linked to ours, was not
Izzie, but another. A gaunt, lean face peered close into my own
through the dusk as I stooped to see my cousin, and the eyes were
of cold steel grey instead of brown. The skin was lined and furrowed,
and projecting teeth of an aged woman gleamed faintly
below the great hooked nose. It was mère Corbillard who stood
between us, hanging her withered hands upon our arms, her sinister
face so close that her straggling thin grey hair even touched our
shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dreadful sight was as vividly defined as the white face of
my cousin which I saw the same instant just beyond: and by his
ghastly pallor, and the water in his eyes, I knew that he had seen
her too. His lips were parted, his right hand was raised and
clenched. I thought he was going to strike, but instead, wrenching
himself violently free, he sprang to one side with an expression of
horror that was more a cry than actual words. There was a shriek;
whose I dare not say; it may have been my own for all my scattered
senses can remember. To this day what I recall was the sensation
of death upon my arm, and the glare of those steely eyes that peered
triumphantly into my own — then a momentary darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All happened in less than a second. The figure had broken loose
from between us, and was racing down the road like a flying
shadow — towards the cemetery. Yet the figure we watched an
instant before starting in frantic pursuit was unmistakably — Izzie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my cousin belongs the reward of prompt action and recapture.
We simply flew. And he caught the child long before
she reached the forbidden gates. Weeping, white and frightened,
we half carried her indoors, and explained to her alarmed mother
that she had been taken suddenly ill, &lt;em&gt;crise de nerfs&lt;/em&gt;, as Daddy,
with presence of mind, described it. It was not the first time; Izzie
had been too often hysterical to cause undue anxiety. Mother will
never know the truth unless she reads this story, which is unlikely,
since her mending and darning leave her little leisure for newspapers.
My cousin and myself have discussed the thing &lt;em&gt;ad
nauseam&lt;/em&gt;, and, as I have indicated, he explained it in a variety of
ways. But neither of us know what Izzie thought or felt. We,
of course, dared not ask her, and the child has never volunteered a
word. That she was severely frightened only is clear. She never
passes the cemetery alone now, and the name of old mère Corbillard
has not passed her lips a single time. My cousin's discovery of
the horror, however, coincided with my own. Comparing notes
proved that. He had been aware of no uneasy sensations previously
as I had been. Telepathy, therefore, was the clue he
finally decided on. &amp;quot;It covers more ground than that word 'possession'
and has besides,&amp;quot; as he said &amp;quot;a sort of scientific sound.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Pelham
reached
the doctor's
house on the
stroke of half-past
eleven, and as he
pushed the Night Bell
button he felt pleased
with his punctuality.
He had kept the
appointment to the
minute. He looked
like a traveller just off the train, yet not
quite suitably dressed for a warm night
in summer. A hint of adventure might
have betrayed itself to a discerning eye.
In addition to a heavy overcoat, he
carried a plaid rug, and a walker's knapsack
was slung across one shoulder, while
a stout stick and a felt hat completed
the outfit. His mind ran over the contents
of the knapsack for the twentieth time —
candles, thermos of coffee, sandwiches, book,
pistol; and the keys were in his pocket. He
had forgotten nothing. His bright eyes
betrayed a certain tension;
he was excited;
the occasional shiver
that ran down his
spine this warm June
night, he assured himself,
was anticipation
merely. Perhaps it
was. He remembered
telling his friend, Dr.
Feldman, that he
intended to go in any
case. &amp;quot;I shall sit up till dawn,&amp;quot; he said.
&amp;quot;If you won't come, I shall go alone.&amp;quot; He
had meant it, too, only that was in the daytime,
and now, with the darkness, his mood
had shifted. Companionship, he realized
would be most desirable. The presence of
burly Dr. Feldman, with his black beard,
his deep voice, his big shoulders, and his
clear brown eyes, would be undeniably
welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave the bell another push, pressing it
hard, for the minutes had slipped by. &amp;quot;I'm
on the tick,&amp;quot; he repeated, looking at his
watch again. &amp;quot;He said he would be ready
at eleven-thirty sharp, barring an urgent call.
Ah!&amp;quot; he reflected, with sudden uneasiness,
&amp;quot;I'd rather forgotten that!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice close behind him made him start,
and turning sharply he saw the door wide
open and the parlour-maid upon the step.
She had been speaking, he realized, for a
moment or two, but at first he hardly took
in what she was saying. Then his heart
sank. &amp;quot;Gone out!&amp;quot; he stammered, in
obvious dismay. &amp;quot;But the doctor expected
me! We had an appointment!&amp;quot; He was
rather flustered. &amp;quot;It's just eleven-thirty, the
time he said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There was an important call,
sir. Dr. Feldman left this for
you.&amp;quot; He read the note hurriedly
on the mat. &amp;quot;I'm
called out,&amp;quot; it ran. &amp;quot;Urgent
case. I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; go. It shouldn't
take long, and I'll join you in
the house the moment I'm
free. Leave key under the
door. M. F., 11 p.m.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The doctor told me to
say, sir, that he should
meet you &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he heard
the girl's voice through
his shock of disappointment;
&amp;quot;and
that he would
bring his own
things with
him for the
night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man's composure was upset.
&amp;quot;Yes, I see,&amp;quot; he mumbled, stupidly; &amp;quot;we
had arranged to walk instead of taking a
taxi, so as not to attract attention — &amp;quot;
He paused, realizing that the girl would not
know what he was talking about. &amp;quot;Will
you come in, sir, and wait?&amp;quot; she asked,
noticing his hesitation. No, he wouldn't do
that. He thanked her. &amp;quot;It's all right,&amp;quot; he
said, as casually as he could, then turned —
it cost him a certain effort — and walked
slowly down the deserted street alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot; he noticed; the disinclination
to leave companionship and light.
The shock of disappointment rather surprised
him too: its strength, its almost bitter
flavour. Something that had lain unacknowledged
in him all the day, that had
become more insistent as the dusk drew on,
something he had deliberately concealed
from himself, was now suddenly so clear
that he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to face it. Pretence had become
childish merely. He did face it. The prospect
of sitting up all night alone in an empty
house he did not relish. &amp;quot;It's absurd,&amp;quot; he
admitted,&amp;quot;but I am, I suppose, a bit
nervous!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made his way slowly, very slowly,
across the dim Bloomsbury square in the
direction of the unoccupied mansion, turning
from time to time to see if anyone might be
following him. He would have given a
good deal to see the burly figure swinging
down the street, the black beard flying. But
pedestrians were few, and men with beards
were rarer still. The failure of his friend,
though understandable, had disconcerted
him more than he cared to admit. &amp;quot;Barring
an urgent call,&amp;quot; the doctor had said, and
the urgent call had come — an unfortunate,
rather an odd, coincidence, the young man
felt. As a specialist the doctor's time was
fairly regular, night calls an exception. An
unwelcome flavour of question, though not
yet of doubt, crept in. His old friend, he
remembered, had not exactly favoured this
expedition. &amp;quot;If you are sincere when you
say you want this experience for your new
book,&amp;quot; he had said, reluctantly, &amp;quot;all right,
then I'll come with you. If nothing happens,
at least I can study &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; The mental
specialist was not interested in so-called
hauntings, but the reactions of a human mind
under the stress of unusual emotion might
interest him. He laughed and yielded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham drew nearer and nearer to the
great empty mansion he had visited already
in the daytime; its large echoing hall he
could easily visualize, the wide creaking
staircase, the carpetless corridors, the smaller
drawing-room on the first floor where he
proposed to keep his vigil. They lay in
darkness now  — shadows, silence, emptiness,
devoid of normal occupants, at least. It
was a place that called for companionship
of a robust order. The house, with its grim,
dreadful story supported by incontrovertible
facts, stood waiting for him only a few hundred
yards down the deserted street. He
could already make out its square, uncompromising
shape, its unwashed windows
peering sideways at him. He found himself
walking slower and slower, dawdling, hesitating,
playing for time. An occasional pedestrian
passed him, and twice at least he recognized
his friend, only to discover his mistake
when they were almost abreast. A taxi
whizzed by noisily, a policeman laboriously
examined innocent doors, but the neighbourhood
lay otherwise still and heavy in
the thickish, humid June night. Gloomy it
was, the houses gaunt and gloomy too, and
the particular house that waited for him
came nearer till at last he stood opposite to
it. Instead of going in — he passed it, with
a quick glance at the staring windows. He
took a turn round the square. &amp;quot;I'll wait till
twelve,&amp;quot; he told himself. &amp;quot;When the clocks
strike midnight, I'll go in — whether Feldman
has come or not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made himself this promise, he
held to it. The policeman helped a little,
perhaps, for Pelham realized that he was a
suspicious figure, mooning about with rug
and knapsack in this desultory fashion, and
questions were the last thing he wanted.
The house soon faced him again, the policeman
a good way down the street: no one
was in sight, the clocks were striking the
hour. Walking boldly up the steps, he
inserted the key, entered the black hole that
gaped before him, and closed the door quietly
behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, perhaps, yes, but a hundred
echoes went flying none the less, as though
the place were alive with footsteps, then
dying away into the deep silence they had
broken. The darkness was at first impenetrable.
A window was open somewhere, for
the last strokes of twelve came clearly down
the stairs. And immediately, before there
had been time to move towards a plan of
any sort, there happened two disagreeable
things, both of which he could explain, but
which he disliked because they revealed too
sharply his own condition. The second of
these two he explained, indeed — with
difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, as he stood in the well of blackness,
not moving, breathing rather low,
thinking what he would do next, was a
sound close beside him; at his feet it seemed:
a curious shuffling sound, and accompanied
by a light, stroking touch upon his shoulder,
with the result that he had jumped a yard
and raised his arm to ward off a possible
blow before he realized that it was merely
the plaid rug which had slipped from his
shoulder and fallen with a faint swishing
noise upon the stone floor. He stooped and
picked it up, cursing his silly nerves. his
movement rapid, as though he felt safer in
an upright position, and it was a moment
later that the second disagreeable thing
occurred, the one he explained less easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened in this way. The instinct of
self-preservation was already automatically
at work, for while one hand picked up the
rug, the other, dropping the knapsack
clutched the flashlight in his coat pocket.
and had actually switched it on as he rose
into an upright position again. Holding it
askew, in that first second, the beam shot
along the hall floor, and the staircase went
directly in its full glare. The blaze.
however, was enough for him to catch sight
out of the corner of his eye, of  — Dr. Feldman,
black beard and all, standing motionless
peering down upon him over the banisters.
Close to the top of the first flight he was, and
the very same instant, before the beam could
show him fully, he had passed silently and
rapidly round the angle and on to the landing
above. The following beam, now turned
full after him, showed no one. Stairs, landing
and banisters were undeniably empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham did not move, he did not start,
much less did he jump; no single muscle.
in fact, stirred, The reaction was of another
kind: his heart missed a beat. Breath, at
the first gasp, was unmanageable, and at
the second — well, some vivid instinct made
silence preferable to calling out. To shout,
&amp;quot;Hullo, Max! Doctor, is that you?&amp;quot; in
the great echoing hall was impossible.
Besides — he already had found the line of
explanation — the figure was not Dr. Feldman
at all. Instinctively, even before he began
to argue, he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it was not his friend.
There could be no answer to his call. Dr.
Feldman was not in the building with him.
No one — he almost said it audibly — was in
the building with him. The figure was
imaginary, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His critical mind, nerves or no nerves,
began instantly to argue towards firm
conviction. The sudden light, rushing
shadows distorted by startled nerves, the
fact that Feldman's personality lay vividly
in his thoughts, that he longed for him
eagerly, hoping with a kind of vehemence
that he would turn up any minute now — this
was quite enough to manufacture the
desired figure out of a sudden glare and a
flock of leaping shadows. Holding the beam
more or less steadily upon the empty stairs
and corner of the landing, he explained away
the disagreeable thing. &amp;quot;Why, even in the
street I mistook two fellows for him till I
got close enough to see my mistake!&amp;quot;
Beards, he remembered, with a faint smile,
were uncommon these days, rare enough
to make an impression. The production of
a figure with bearded face was easy enough
with flying shadows. There had been no
sound of footsteps. And, as he argued, the
premonitory shiver down his spine, while it
did not wholly pass, grew a little less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind, that is to say, provided a
passable explanation, although emotion,
being unable to argue, remained discontented
and uneasy. Emotion, he realized,
would be his problem. &amp;quot;It's always primitive,
credulous, superstitious,&amp;quot; he reminded
himself emphatically. &amp;quot;To observe its
behaviour and to note the antics of imagination
is why I'm here to-night.&amp;quot;, And wisely
then, before emotion might gain any further
advantage, he decided upon action. He
would search the house from top to bottom
before settling down to his long vigil. A
trick? A practical joke? His friend's
passionate interest in mental experiment?
The question of that &amp;quot;urgent call&amp;quot; again
flashed past and vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving his paraphernalia on the floor,
he took the pistol from the knapsack and
began at once his search of the empty
building, With firm, echoing steps, he
moved slowly up the staircase, flashing his
light in all directions as he went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large empty building is not inviting
in the darkness, nor is a flashlight,
with the contrast of inky blackness
just beyond its beam, the best way of
exploring it. The search undoubtedly
required nerve. This house, moreover, was
not merely empty; it was empty because no
one could live in it. So devoid was it,
indeed, of a pleasant living atmosphere
that two successive tenants, and that quite
recently, had chosen to die in it — by their
own hands. And the reason for their choice,
according to Pelham's investigations, added
nothing to the homeliness of the atmosphere.
Two years before them, another tenant, the
origin of the present horror apparently, had
also done away with himself, after first
doing away, in ghastly fashion, with the
rest of his family. Crazed by drugs, drink,
love, or something equally powerful and
devastating  —  Pelham had been unable
exactly to ascertain — he had been found
among the grim remnants of his fearful
orgy, strangled by his own hands. His
imitators, it was held, owed their similar
fates to his vile, terrific, posthumous influence.
Subsequent occupiers objected
strenuously, broke their leases, paid money
rather than stay, even went to court. The
house, thus, was in the market for a song —
and young Pelham was now searching its
dismal entrails at midnight with a shoddy
little flashlight. His object was to experience
at first hand, and for the purposes of a scene
in his new novel, what an imaginative man
would feel during an all-night vigil.c He
himself was an imaginative man, and he
got his &amp;quot;copy.&amp;quot; He got more besides.
The details remain the strangest among the
numerous remarkable cases in Dr. Feldman's
notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search was thorough, but unproductive.
It established the fact that there was
no one in the great dismal building save
himself. It was hardly a reassuring process
for a nervous temperament, and it called
upon all his pluck to go through certain of
the rooms — the servants' quarters, for instance,
on the top floor, the offices in the
basement, and certain large pieces that had
two doors. There was always the feeling
that someone trailed stealthily behind him,
that he was watched, that the piled shadows
concealed a figure. Once a door banged,
there were creakings everywhere, there were
groans and cracks and whispers down the
draughty passages. But the place, otherwise,
was still as death, holding its musty
smell, its gaping emptiness, its air of rather
sinister expectancy in common with most
other big unoccupied buildings. And, at the
end, Pelham stood in the hall again with the
satisfied feeling that he had done his job
faithfully, and that he could now settle
down in the small drawing-room for the
vigil proper. He had brought in a couple
of deck chairs during the day; he had his
book and candles, his coffee. Whether
Feldman came or did not come, he could
manage it. If anything happened, he now
told himself, he could manage that too.
He went upstairs and settled in. He was
calmer — yes, even quite calm. He was master
of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was here that Pelham's version (marked
in red ink in Dr. Feldman's notebooks)
first caught the attention of the specialist.
The word &amp;quot;calm&amp;quot; was underlined, a mark
of interrogation in the margin. The search
of the building should have left the nerves
on edge; instead, the reverse had happened  —
the young man had recovered his
normal quiet. He
felt &amp;quot;calm,&amp;quot; he
could &amp;quot;manage
anything&amp;quot; that
might happen
later. &amp;quot;Didn't
particularly notice
this odd calmness
in himself,&amp;quot; ran the
expert comment.
In talking it over
afterwards, Pelham
used another
adjective: &amp;quot;sedative.&amp;quot;
Uneasiness
had gone, he
declared, &amp;quot;just as
though I'd taken
a sedative and it
was beginning to
work. I observed
everything
keenly,&amp;quot; he tried
to explain, &amp;quot;but
things that half
an hour before
would have
startled and made
me jump  —  well,
they just didn't.
I watched them
happen, missing
nothing, but
without any nasty
reaction, horror
least of all. I was
prepared for anything
I might see.
Like being doped
almost.&amp;quot; And in
the doctor's notebook,
on this point, is an interesting
and suggestive comment: &amp;quot;This curious
preliminary calmness, though P. noticed
it suddenly, came on gradually no doubt.
He was aware of it only when achieved.
His own word 'sedative' indicates slow
approach. Morbid excitement had passed
completely, but acute observation nowhere
impaired. He felt 'prepared' for what
might follow. A &lt;em&gt;preparation&lt;/em&gt;!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- {{The deck-chair was occupied by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame, black beard and all.}} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man, now settled comfortably
in his deck-chair, a rug over
his knees, the two candles on a packing-case
behind his head, sat reading his book
with one part of his mind, while, with
another part, he stared, listened, watched,
every muscle and nerve in alert tension, yet
wholly at his ease. His original jumpiness
had vanished, nervousness was gone, had
exhausted itself perhaps. Opposite to him
was the unoccupied chair intended for his
friend. Two blindless windows on his right
gave upon roofs and a night-sky too hazy
for stars to show. On his left, wide open,
was the door through which the top of the
staircase, with the few feet of banisters the
sham Dr. Feldman had peered over, was
just visible. The carpetless room had no
stick of furniture, the blank walls marked
only with lines of dirt where pictures and a
large mirror had been hung. A glass chandelier
above his chair sparkled faintly in
the flickering candle-light. The light, of
course, was poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he sat reading while the hours
passed and the night drew towards morning.
From time to time he pricked his ears;
creakings on the
stairs, cracks
of wood on the
floors above,
sounds in the big
hall below, those
he noticed without
a qualm, but
attributed quite
rightly to their
natural causes.
No purpose, no
intent, no meaning,
living or posthumous,
could be
ascribed to them.
Nothing approaching
a footstep,
much less a voice,
broke the deep
silence that
wrapped the
building from roof
to kitchen. Yet
his composure was
remarkable rather,
considering his
temperament and
his recent jumpiness.
And the
young man felt
disappointment
growing on him.
Even if he saw
and heard nothing,
he had hoped for
unusual reactions
of interesting kind.
These did not
come. After his
first bout of rather
boyish &amp;quot;nerves,&amp;quot;
his recording apparatus,
imaginative
or critical,
registered —
nothing. His experiment
seemed
a failure; the
scene in his book
would gain no verisimilitude from the
description of an actual experience. He
even began to feel glad that Dr. Feldman
after all had not wasted a night's
sleep for nothing. Even if he saw a
figure now, his attitude would be one
merely of critical examination: could
he touch it as solid, walk through it,
could it answer questions or show intelligence
in response to his advances,
his calm, collected, cross-examining  advances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman! He put his book
down, Ah! He had almost forgotten
him. The first keen longing, the bitter
disappointment, these, too, had left him.
He realized that, for a considerable time
now, he had not been alertly waiting for
his footstep, his voice, his brown eyes.
This expectancy had left him too. This
indifference, this forgetfulness, Dr. Feldman
also stressed in his own notebook — as a
proof that Pelham's mind was no longer
working normally. &amp;quot;Noticed his own
indifference,&amp;quot; ran the comment in red ink,
&amp;quot;but not particularly surprised at it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dr. Feldman!&amp;quot; And Pelham abruptly
realized, for the first time, that he had
forgotten to leave the key outside the front
door. Completely overlooked it! Even if
Dr. Feldman had come, he could not have
got in. Perhaps he had already come — and
gone. He would probably not have rung,
much less would he have knocked. Possibly,
indeed, reflected Pelham, the doctor might
welcome the excuse and go home to bed.
Well, it didn't matter, the young man
thought, as he went down cautiously in the
dark to remedy his oversight, but leaving
his electric torch on the packing-case. There
was nothing of interest here for his clever,
learned friend. He was relieved, in fact,
to have no critical observer of his own
disappointment, of this flat, uneventful, and
rather foolish night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key in hand, he opened the big door and
peered out into the deserted street. It was
between two and three in the morning; soon
the grey light would come in the sky. No
one was to be seen. He paused a moment,
standing on the step, then came back inside,
shutting the door carelessly, and with a
good deal of echoing noise, but again forgetting
to leave the key outside, an omission
only realized long afterwards. He started
to cross the hall. A faint light from his
open door above filtered down, so that the
banisters were just visible. And it was as
he crossed the hall that someone brushed by,
and passed in front of him up the staircase.
Though no actual touch was registered, he
was quite positive of this. Whether he
actually heard the steps he could not
swear, but that someone who had been
standing close beside him in this dark
hall now moved up the stairs ahead of him,
he was convinced beyond any possible
doubt. Had there been doubt, indeed, it
was at once negatived, for a second later he
saw the outline of a man slip along the
banisters overhead and move rapidly along
the landing. The outline disappeared towards
the door where the faint light issued. The
person, whoever it was, had gone into his
room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham went after this figure; he climbed
the stairs very quickly, almost ran along
the short stretch of landing, and, without a
sign of hesitation, entered the room himself.
&amp;quot;I burst into it, in fact,&amp;quot; he described it
afterwards. &amp;quot;And there, in the chair
opposite to mine,&amp;quot; he said, with intense
conviction, &amp;quot;sat — yourself. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;, Max, sat
in that chair.&amp;quot; The deck-chair was occupied
by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame.
black beard and all. The head was sunk a
little forwards, down upon the chest rather;
the eyes were closed; the breathing was
regular and sounded heavy. &amp;quot;You looked
asleep, though naturally I knew this was
impossible.&amp;quot; And in his written version,
Pelham, describing his own reaction to this
&amp;quot;bit of nonsense,&amp;quot; emphasized his impatient
resentment that a &amp;quot;friend like you,
Max, should have played this trifling, rather
dangerous trick upon me.&amp;quot; He felt sore,
even angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For in that first instant of inspection.
young Pelham realized that the doctor had
somehow secreted himself in the house from
the beginning, that the &amp;quot;urgent call&amp;quot; was
a thought-out detail, that it was, in fact, an
ill-judged practical joke. He remembered
his own first fugitive doubt. Dr. Feldman
was not going to lose a night's sleep for
nothing; he had always meant to make
use of the occasion to give his romantic
friend a shock, then study his nervous
reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Pelham resented the trick, its perilous
foolishness in view of his own nerves
and the fact that he had a pistol. So much
did he resent it that, taking his own chair
again, he sat there staring at his friend, a
kind of dull anger in him, giving no single
thought as to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the doctor had contrived
his trivial little plan. He did not speak, he
made no attempt to tackle him about it.
he did not even prod him out of this idiotic
pretence of being asleep. He just sat and
stared, this sullen, rather sulky anger in his
heart. He felt no relief that his friend had
come and now sat before him; he no longer
needed him, nor was his presence comforting.
Comfort, even companionship, of that sort
he did not want any more. Deep annoyance,
contempt to the point of bitterness almost,
was all he felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman, it seems, meanwhile
kept up this game of his with a steady
perfection that, the other felt, would
have been admirable in a better cause. He
maintained his pose of sleep without a flaw.
It was good acting. No sign of expression
showed itself in his face. The body was
limp with the relaxation of a man in deep
slumber. And the longer young Pelham
watched him, the more his angry vexation
grew. His thought found words such as
&amp;quot;Idiot, imbecile,&amp;quot; phrases like &amp;quot;Amazing
trick for a man like you, a great mental
specialist, to play&amp;quot; — and finally, after
perhaps half an hour of this persistent folly
on the &amp;quot;specialist's&amp;quot; part of silence and
immobility, since it betrayed no sign of
explaining itself, Pelham took up his book
again and went on reading. He was furious,
yet wanted to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic, no doubt, the situation was, but
he was in no mood to appreciate its comedy.
He obstinately refused to speak, and in his
mind now was a sort of boyish determination
that he would meet the other at his own
game, and beat him at it too! He made
no sign, no sound. He merely read. The
minutes passed. Perhaps half an hour slipped
by, perhaps longer. His obstinacy remained
cast-iron. Dr. Feldman, for his part, also
kept up the nonsense; he aped slumber to
perfection; his breathing was heavy, heavy;
the black beard rising and falling with the
movement of his chest; the brown eyes
always tightly closed — till at last, the
sound of a clock striking the hour came
faintly into the room where these two sat.
Pelham counted the strokes, and they were
three. There was a gleam of dawn. He
looked up suddenly from his book, hardly
knowing why —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this time he started. His blood
ebbed, then came back with a rush. What
was it? What did it mean? At the first
sight, in this faint early light, Dr. Feldman
looked precisely as before, ordinary, normal:
at the second, he looked —  amazing. Every
atom of attention Pelham could muster
concentrated in his eyes. He stared till they
smarted, But his spine ran icy cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a difference, yet this difference
remained concealed. At the first glimpse it
was Max Feldman who faced him; at the
second, it was someone else. Thus he phrased
it in his written version, and the brevity was
significant. Here was something, apparently,
he could not describe. He shivered all over.
The former queer insensitiveness, the numbness,
had begun to pass. The &amp;quot;sedative &amp;quot;
effect was leaving him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, staring with all his energy, with all
available concentration, at his familiar
friend, he knew himself dreadfully overwrought.
Yet that &amp;quot;second glimpse &amp;quot;
refused to come back; the amazing
aspect of this well-known shape kept
hidden. He &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; seen it, however. It was, he
divined, still there. The blood gushed and
ebbed alternately; his feet, his back were
cold. He was &amp;quot;all on edge,&amp;quot; like a terrified
girl, The figure in the chair, so far as he
could analyse, had not altered; the burly
frame, the broad shoulders, the black
heard, the eyes closed in &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; remained
as before. &amp;quot;The idiot,&amp;quot; he tried to say,
&amp;quot;still pretends,&amp;quot; but his thought refused to
frame the words — because they were somewhere,
somehow false. &amp;quot;Idiot&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;asleep,&amp;quot; at any rate, were merely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His written description of what followed
was extremely, curiously brief. His own
eyes remained glued, unable to move. He
stared and stared. The beard moved up
and down with the slow heaving of the great
chest, the relaxed body betrayed no tension,
the head sank forwards and downwards as
before. Then, suddenly, that &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;
glimpse, that &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; aspect came stealing
horribly back. The face, hitherto devoid
of expression, had begun to change. It was
slowly altering. Black and white entered
into it somehow, a white that was passionless,
a black that was diabolical. The
mouth, under the dark hair, sagged; the
eyebrows took a slanting twist, the jaw
beneath the beard thrust out. It became,
slowly but decisively, an entirely different
and an atrocious face. The mask slipped
gradually downwards from it. And young
Pelham, now bereft of power to move,
stared helplessly at the appalling change.
He was staring, he tried to tell himself, at
something he could not believe, something
that was not possible, something that
human experience cannot admit. But yet
he witnessed it. And he could not move his
eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Feldman, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Max Feldman, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
my friend,&amp;quot; his thought struggled to cry
out, then realized vaguely that thought
was stifled in him, no longer operating.
Thought and volition had simultaneously
disappeared. And the head then suddenly
moved a little to one side. It slowly shifted.
The beard, at a new angle, now revealed the
neck. There was no collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tried to scream, to shriek, but breath
failed him. Horror dropped over him like
ice. He trembled from head to foot. The
shuddering was audible, his teeth clattered,
his feet tapped the wooden floor. But he
still stared helplessly, because sight was
riveted beyond any power of his that could
either move his eyes or close them. He
became aware then that this demoniacal face
that aped his friend was about to change
still further. How he knew this lay beyond
him. He did know it. A faint quiver of the
cheeks betrayed it, possibly. Something
ghastly ran across the skin. He knew the
eyes were going to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a further movement of the
head. It lolled to one side — frightfully. The
collarless neck was creased with dull red
lines. The same instant the two eyes opened,
giving back his own awful, fascinated stare.
They were bright, fixed, maniacal eyes.
Moreover, they were not brown, but black.
They gazed into his own with murder in
their depths. And the whole figure then
gave a convulsive shudder and began to
alter visibly like the face. With extreme
swiftness, as in a cinema, this alteration
supervened. The great frame seemed suddenly
to have grown emaciated, the big
shoulders sank and drooped, only the black
beard still flowed down the collarless neck
that was marked with its hideous red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- {{Facing him on the step, an electric torch blazing in his hand, stood Dr. Feldman}} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the outline rose. Leaving the
chair without visible effort, it stood
up, it wavered a moment, half staggering,
half lurching; the arms projected
abruptly; the hands opened long, muscular
fingers that moved through the air toward
his throat. He saw the eyes behind them —
like shining lamps — close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tremendous clamour that broke
here with its sudden clashing gave him, it
seems, the power to move his muscles. A
bell rang furiously, there was a violent
banging on a door. The building echoed.
The awful figure, though it did not seem to
pause in its advance, came, singularly, no
nearer actually to his face and throat. A
measure of volition, startled into activity
perhaps by the resounding noise, returned
to him. He sprang up, he shrieked as
though his heart had burst, he staggered
but he reached the door. He was down the
steps in what seemed literally a couple of
enormous leaps, and across the dark hall.
The same second he was fumbling at the big
front door, where the knocking sounded.
He opened it. Facing him on the step, an
electric torch blazing in his hand, stood —
Dr. Feldman. He came in, closing the door
behind him with a bang. &amp;quot;Frightfully sorry,
old man, but it took me longer than I
thought. You forgot the key —&amp;quot; was all
young Pelham heard before darkness fell
over him and he fainted in his friend's arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swoon, rather than a faint, it was,
lasting perhaps a minute. A sip of brandy
from the doctor's flask brought the blood
back to normal ways. There followed
confused talk, questions, and somewhat incoherent
answers, and then — Dr. Feldman
insisted firmly on this — the visit to the room
upstairs. They went together, side by side,
arm in arm in fact, into an entirely empty
room. The candles stood guttering on the
packing-case, electric torch and pistol beside
them, a book on the floor, and a couple of
unoccupied deck-chairs opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But young Pelham, shaking from head to
foot, white as chalk, found no very intelligent
words, and the specialist, thoroughly at home
among conditions of this kind, took him
home, administered a mild sedative, and
read at his leisure some days later the
account of Pelham's night. He had insisted
on a written version first. Talk followed, a
little study of his own as well, but this was
for his private notebooks, as were also two
facts he took some trouble to ascertain —
namely, that the murderer used drugs on
his victims as on himself, and also, oddly
enough, that his maniac face held black eyes
and was adorned with a black beard into
the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimble was not too proud to fight, but he was too old, too
stiff, too blind; he could not drill properly, because he really had
to think a moment before he knew which was his left and which
his right. There are some men who can positively do nothing; he
was one of them. With the best intentions in the world, burning,
zealous intentions too, he was yet useless. Unable to help, he
lost that comfort which comes the moment one's smaller burden is
merged in the collective burden of the nation. That peace being
denied him, his interest in the war on the other hand being intense,
he merely — &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;. Morning, noon, and night, he read. He
read all the papers, but on Sunday he read only four, not counting
&amp;quot;extras.&amp;quot; Sunday was his day off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He plunged with the ease of a bird from the heights of optimism
to the depths of pessimism. It wore him out. He believed
everything he read. Every move made on the great chess-board
was a clever trap into which either the enemy or the Allies would
march blind-eyed. He yearned to warn the latter. In time, however,
the &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; idea collapsed; it never came off; the lure was
non-existent. A certain paper declared that the enemy would
never be caught without its glasses … he gave up buying it for
a week, then surreptitiously went back to it because it &lt;em&gt;proved&lt;/em&gt; that
the Germans were using their last reserves. A bad communiqué
could keep him awake at night, so could a very good one.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Eastern and Western fronts, at length, he switched
off upon the Balkans, till he became so entangled that he — well,
though his walls were covered with maps, he never could remember
even whether Roumania was north of Bulgaria, or vice versa;
nor which country claimed Bucharest or Sofia as its capital. Invariably
he had to inspect his maps. Bucharest, since it began
with B, ought to belong to Bulgaria; sometimes, judging by the
telegrams, it did, sometimes, judging by the articles, it didn't.
The Balkans became a gigantic jig-saw puzzle, all corners and
curves and points and angles that would not fit. The coloured
flags pricked his fingers, the maps got stained, the strip of carpet
below them grew threadbare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time he confined himself to picture-papers, till he read
that most of the scenes were made somewhere in Surrey, or taken
from manoeuvres of five years ago. He flung himself next upon
strategy and diagrams of positions, till the chintzes on his chairs
expressed surprise and peril, and the very blood in his strained
eye-balls mapped the empty air with danger. Reality faded from
the world. He himself &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; up the street or &amp;quot;retired&amp;quot;
to his bedroom. On the way to his bath he muttered left, right,
left, left, left — halt, then had to &amp;quot;retreat in perfect order&amp;quot; for
his forgotten sponge and towel. He confined himself in the last
resort to &amp;quot;official news.&amp;quot;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This called for grim restraint, but the truth was he was getting
a little frightened. His speech showed signs of trouble, and sounds
became audible in his head occasionally — z … sz … scz … czs …
and pmj or mjp … and the like. He became aware of showers of
them sprinkling almost visibly through the air — in the darkness,
explosive, spitting sparks. They even pricked him. His tongue
and throat grew sore. And there were other symptoms that
alarmed him. The worst, perhaps, was the mute j. He had somehow
got full of them without knowing it, either swallowed them or
breathed them in, he knew not which; but in any case he was interiorly
somewhat crowded with soft heaps of these mute j's.
They were akin to microbes of a suppressed illness; for any
moment — it was horrible to think of — they might emerge, appear,
themselves, become not mute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; doing, Dimble?&amp;quot; asked Spriggins at the
Club one day, good-naturedly. Spriggins, though bald and
crooked, wore &amp;quot;G. R.&amp;quot; and a big red armlet every Sunday on
route marches that nearly killed him. Dimble looked up helplessly
into his face. He answered. Speech of a kind, at least,
came twanging, buzzing from his lips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ceskz … kivitch … ski … kzs … z . z. z. jjjjjjj!&amp;quot;
he replied. His voice cracked oddly; tiny explosions were audible
inside his chest; his throat held soda-water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not notice how Spriggins got away; he &amp;quot;retreated,&amp;quot;
apparently in good order. It was certainly a rapid movement.
Spriggins was not surrounded, at all events. And he left Dimble
standing there as though he had been burned, destroyed, utterly
devastated till nothing of any value remained inside his outer
physical frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters had grown so serious by this time that he made a prodigious
effort, and renounced all papers whatsoever — for an entire
day. For twenty-four hours he read no news, no expert articles,
no forecasts, no résumés, no analyses of the Balkan soul, nor one
single report from a neutral traveller just returned from everywhere.
He did not even look at a line from an official or diplomatic
source whose authority it is impossible to doubt. He
moved no single pin upon his many maps. He lay in darkness —
he also lay in bed. He starved. A strange hunger woke in him:
He knew an intolerable emptiness. He slept a little, however,
and murmured in his sleep — for it was troubled — &amp;quot;Official news,
official news … csz .. ksz .. j.j.j.…!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimble recovered a bit and lived his life as best he could. He
was careful now, not to say cautious. He reconnoitred before
every single act; also he deployed. But things went rather quickly
after that. He slept by day in a darkened room, and went out
only in the night. He could not see the posters thus; the paper
man at the corner, who now cut him dead instead of smiling cheerfully,
could be avoided. This was the serious stage for Dimble.
By the candlelight in his bedroom he noticed curious marks upon
his arm; the skin seemed mottled. He said, &amp;quot;Bites, by Nicholas!&amp;quot;
and thought of queer, invisible insects. Yet the marks
apparently traced a pattern; they had design, meaning, almost
rhythm. They were horribly familiar. And then he knew — they
were j's. The mute j's were coming out! &amp;quot;Spies!&amp;quot; he cried in
terror. &amp;quot;I'm betrayed! I've harboured spies! All this time
they've been in my very midst! He knew he was done for then,
but he did not fully realise his ghastly position until, the following
night, he detected further marks. They were quite distinct.
He easily made them out in the dark. He saw &amp;quot;Official …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a dreadful business. He could not tell a soul, because
his communications were all cut. He faced the worst with courage;
no one should say he was a coward or a slacker. He ordered
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the papers again, and sat reading them by daylight in his
room. He went boldly to the Club and read them openly,
brazenly, with true defiance. He agreed with everything he read,
he understood it all, but he had no feelings now, he was neither
optimistic nor the reverse. He simply read. … It was odd, but
no one noticed him. In his room one day the landlady came in to
brush and sweep — she ignored his presence, tidying the papers up
all round him as though he were not there at all. The same thing
happened at the Club. A waiter even tried to smooth him out
and hang him on the file, and once he was nearly — oh, it was
wicked — nearly picked up and offered to another member, Spriggins.
Only, luckily, Spriggins had the decency to refuse him.
He did it so nicely too: &amp;quot;No, thanks,&amp;quot; he said with a little
smile, &amp;quot;I've read it. There's nothing in it, anyhow!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was that very night when Dimble woke towards the early
hours, and heard a crackling as he turned in bed. Terror gripped
him. He lay quite still and listened. It was at the end of the
bed apparently — a faint swishing, crackling noise with tiny reports
accompanying it. He moved his foot; the sound was repeated.
Something glimmered dimly. He moved the other foot, his arm
as well, he sat up briskly. There was a leaping rush of the vague
white form across the air; with a tap and slither it fell upon the
floor beside him. He stooped over to pick it up, and his hand
came into contact with something smooth and warm that was in
the act of settling upon the floor. He felt the little wind it made.
It was, of course, a newspaper. But the same instant, and before
he removed his hand, he knew by the warmth of it that it was
something more besides. It was not different from himself. What
in the world had happened to him? It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; himself. His hand
was on the skin of his bare chest. He was crackling all over —
but very nicely, very crisply. He settled back into bed with a kind
of rush and slither. His terror passed. He felt well pleased with
himself. &amp;quot;It's all right,&amp;quot; he murmured, as he fell asleep. &amp;quot;For
a moment I thought I was a halfpenny one! I must be more careful.
Near shave, that! I must mention it to Spriggins … when
I'm out!&amp;quot; There was an odd smell of printers' ink in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning he came out duly, and Spriggins bought him
for a penny, right enough, and took him in his pocket on a long
route march. While resting for lunch with his company, out by
the Welsh Harp, which is 'Endon Wy', he lit his pipe with him.
Dimble tried to utter a protest, but he stammered horribly. He
could not get his words at all. He made a fizzy, crackling noise
instead — of which Spriggins, puffing the smoke at him, took no
slightest notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Dimble curled up, turned slowly black and passed away
into the wind and fell into a stubble-field near by, and lay there
quite happily until the dew that night came softly down and dissolved
him into nothing — nothing visible or of value at any rate.

&lt;p&gt;This parable on the nature of Law would make a fine preface to any text on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dangerous characters dwell in the penumbra, around the edge of civilized society's illumination—and so do some who merely believe themselves to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the aspects of this author’s singular style of writing is that it sounds as if it is the product of a prior age. Since the author wrote over a century ago, this is unsurprising to present-day readers. Yet, it seems even his contemporaries found the author’s writing to be antiquated—old-fashioned. This suggests the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Why?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having heard such a question, one who writes might well feel some instinctual need to compose an answer. One who writes fiction will feel no particular need for that answer to be truthful. Better it should be unnatural and just a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having come to the metropolis to find inspiration, the narrator instead finds disappointment and declares the city dead.
He feels no kinship with its denizens.
Between the populace and the city they inhabit, he senses only the same kinship as exists between a hermit crab and the dead creature, in whose shell it makes its home.
By a revenant embodiment of the old city, he is shown that its past and future are shaped by the same pattern as its present—and the author comes to discover that he, too, is adrift from his natural place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading this story, the post-postmodern reader may feel an impulse to respond to the author’s sense of alienation from his environment and its inhabitants by naming him misanthrope—or worse—and take this judgment of misanthropy away as the story’s chief significance.
Like returning from the grocery store with the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, but having left all the groceries on the shelves, this is perhaps a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

Lovecraft at Wikisource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This text begins a story, in which an eldritch book precipitates the narrator’s unmooring from the usual relationship that any natural creature shares with space and time.
This new relationship is manifest outwardly as a previously non-existent shadow—a preternatural extension of the narrator smeared into the physical world—and inwardly in his bewilderingly altered perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was written in 1933, 28 years after the &lt;em&gt;Annus Mirabilis&lt;/em&gt; in which the public first learned of what comes to be called Minkowski spacetime.
That Time is not the sugary frosting on a 3-layered cake of Space, but is instead sugar co-equal with the flour, eggs, and butter, which make up the cake &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, is an idea truly mind-bending to any—such as the author—who seeks to wrap his mind around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwood—who influenced Lovecraft—took on the weird subject of spacetime—after its publication in 1905—in &lt;em&gt;Entrance and Exit&lt;/em&gt; (1909), &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Found Out&lt;/em&gt; (1912),  &lt;em&gt;A Victim of Higher Space&lt;/em&gt; (1914), and &lt;em&gt;The Pikestaffe Case&lt;/em&gt;  (1914).
How Lovecraft’s treatment differs from Blackwood’s is that Lovecraft’s narrator speaks from &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that experience, rather than &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; that experience.
An ambitious undertaking, it was perhaps too ambitious, as the story was not completed by its author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Esperanto-English Using Standard Ebooks Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-book glossary entry ordinarily consists of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term to be defined: stored as the dt-term in a dl-description-list, contained in glossary.txt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition: stored as the dd-description in a dl-description-list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synonyms and variations of each term, connecting them to that term: stored as a search-key-map in glossary-search-key-map.xml.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, a glossary is used by a user looking up a word in the text, when this word is encountered. Also, it is significant that the glossary-search-key-map is not well-supported by existing readers and the glossary is intended to work around this limitation, providing good function, while also functioning properly when the support is widely available. These goals are accomplished by using the following formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="text-glossary-xhtml"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;text/glossary.xhtml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glossary file contains a description list with one dt-dd pair per term, in alphabetical order. Using the example, for each entry, make the following replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the term:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;Abdul Alhazred&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; term being described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;abdul-alhazred&lt;/em&gt; as the id with the lower-case, dash-separated, no-diacritics version of this term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the description:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;Abdul-Alhazredo&lt;/em&gt; inside the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; element with the Esperanto transation of the term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;, colon, and space; provide a brief, simple, and consistently arranged Esperanto definition of the term. Do not include any links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the second paragraph, after the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; list all words, separated by comma, in either language which correspond to this definition. Exclude the two words already given. Include variations in tense, number, possessive, etc. that appear in the work and consider include alternate spellings found in Wikipedia. Do not tag these words to indicate their language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;be the same.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Abdul Alhazred&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Alhazred&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;search-key-group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the key-map is not yet well supported by ebook readers. The &amp;quot;Also&amp;quot; line in the glossary is intended as
a workaround. These items are intended to be hidden, though the reading device may present them anyway. But by listing here, the reader should bring up the glossary item during search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="css-local-css"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;css/local.css&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three items here are SE styles, meant to show the glossary items in a good way. The remaining items
are meant to make the English and Esperanto words easy to distinguish during search and in the final document. It is meant to hide the extra
synonyms but present them well in a a helpful way if the reader-device does display them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Mardi Gras was 20 years ago, on my birthday—New Orleans being a place that truly embraces the spirit of my birthday—and for some time, from within a crowd across the street, just after dusk had given way to night; I saw, then watched, the ghostly-blue visage of what seemed to be a woman's face, perfectly still, as it hung in the darkness of an empty Garden District balcony; eyes downcast, unseen, a faint eldritch glow that did not penetrate the surrounding gloom: her expression somber, pensive, maybe even mournful; up above, but not watching, the flambeaux that bobbed, and oblivious to the drums that boomed, parading through the street below—too unreal to be real, yet too real to be anything else—and because the brain itches when it can make no sense of what the sight claims to see, I squinted my eyes, twisting them up, trying to make her corporeal; to manifest her into the world of the living, to shelve her into a warehouse of things, or to send her away entirely to the realm of the fanciful, until finally, she lowered her phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victorian ghosts haunt stairwells, attics, and moors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern ghosts haunt their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mia unua Karnavalo estis antaŭ 20 jaroj, en mia naskiĝtago—Nov-Orleano estante loko kiu vere brakumas la spiriton de mia naskiĝtago—kaj dum iom da tempo, de homamaso trans la strato, tuj post kiam la vesperkrepusko estis cedinta al nokton; mi vidis, tiam rigardis, la fantome-bluan aspekton de tio, kio ŝajnis esti vizaĝo de virino, perfekte senmova, dum ĝi pendis en la mallumo de malplena Ĝarden-Kvartala balkono; okuloj rigardantaj malsupren, neviditaj, malforta preternatura brilo kiu ne penetris la ĉirkaŭantan mornon: ŝia esprimo serioza, pripensema, eble eĉ funebra; supren de, sed ne rigardardante, la torĉoj kiuj balanciĝis, kaj nekonscia pri la tamburoj ke tondris, paradante laŭ la strato sube—tro nereala por esti reala, tamen tro reala por esti io ajn alia—kaj ĉar la cerbo jukas sin kiam ĝi povas fari neniun sencon de tio, kio la vidado asertas vidi, mi strabigis miajn okulojn, tordante ilin streĉe, provante enkorpigi ŝin; manifesti ŝin en la mondo de la viva, enbretigi ŝin en magazeno de objektoj, aŭ forsendi ŝin tute al la regno de la fantazia, ĝis finfine, ŝi malsuprenigis sian poŝtelefonon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viktorinaj fantomoj hantas ŝtuparejojn, mansardojn, kaj erikejojn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modernaj fantomoj hantas iliajn poŝtelefonojn.&lt;/p&gt;
