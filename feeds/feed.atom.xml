&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. T. Smith, the prominent stockbroker
of Capel Court in the City of London, woke that
morning, the sun was streaming into his comfortable
bedroom in a respectable quarter of the
region north of Hyde Park. He felt a curious
sense of exhilaration, a strange glow of happiness. Like a boy
who knows he has done well in an examination, he experienced
a delightful, light-hearted anticipation. And this glow pervaded
his whole being. It was as if he expected some happy event,
a piece of luck, a glorious stroke of chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not define it, but he felt that it was there, almost
within his grasp. So vivid was this happy emotion that he
sprang from the bed and stood in his striped blue and white
pyjamas, staring out of the open window. The sun on his bare
neck was hot, birds were singing in the mangy cedar of the
small garden, a few early hyacinths blazed just below him in a
narrow strip of green. But he saw nothing to account for what
he felt. The sparrows were dirtier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was puzzled. Tightening the belt of his pyjamas which
had become loose in sleep, he smoothed his scanty hair and
rubbed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Had a dream, I suppose,&amp;quot; he mumbled to himself. &amp;quot;A
jolly dream sometimes does the trick,&amp;quot; he added, opening his
jacket wider to let the sun warm his scraggy chest. Only, he
could not remember any dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. T. Smith liked things explained properly, and this
bright happiness lay beyond his explanation. It had nothing
to do with his business, nothing to do with the buying and selling
of shares. He knew that instinctively. His business was
good, but it was not as good as that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stroked his bare chest and smiled. Something important
was going to happen to him. He felt it in his bones. It was
something that might alter his whole life. But of what
kind, he asked himself, opening another button, and staring
fixedly at the milkman in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So methodical was Mr. T. Smith, so regular in his life, that
this stir of emotion upset him rather. His business, inherited
from an uncle, was steady and lucrative. &amp;quot;Mr. T. Smith and
Co.&amp;quot; was respected in the City. It was a family business, his
clients too respectable to allow of mistakes. They lived and
died prepared — by Mr. T. Smith and Co. Irregularities played
no role. His quarters in North London were also eminently
right. His landlady, Miss Slumbubble, had looked after him
for twenty years. She even mended his clothes; added new
pockets when his money, wearing holes, slipped through. The
first time, he remembered, the new pocket was too deep, so
that his hand dipped to his knee to find a coin. But that was
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Withdrawing from the open window, where the milkman
watched him with too much interest, he thought, Mr. T. Smith
dressed and went down to breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You 'ad a good night?&amp;quot; asked Miss Slumbubble as usual,
bringing the invariable eggs and bacon. &amp;quot;You slep' well, Mr.
Smith?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Better than ever, thank you, Miss Slumbubble,&amp;quot; he replied,
also as usual. He wondered if she noticed the excitement that
still burned in him like a flame. He hoped not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently she did not. &amp;quot;That mattress,&amp;quot; she observed,
&amp;quot;is the best in London. And I always make your bed myself,
Mr. Smith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had said this every morning for the past twenty years,
and Mr. T. Smith knew exactly the reply she expected. &amp;quot;I
thought you had.&amp;quot; He produced it with a smile, and began to
eat his eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Miss Slumbubble could not know with what curious
excitement he had sprung from the &amp;quot;best mattress in London&amp;quot;
an hour ago, nor with what a strange sense of anticipatory
happiness he started forth upon his day. He put his impeccable
tie, if possible, straighter, he tugged at his moustache, he took
his umbrella, he set forth. &amp;quot;I feel a bit of a dog, you know,
this morning,&amp;quot; he caught himself saying under his breath —
then turned sharply, for Miss Slumbubble stood behind him.
She invariably saw him off to the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah! Good-bye, Miss Slumbubble,&amp;quot; he exclaimed as usual.
&amp;quot;I shall be back by seven o'clock.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And your dinner will be ready for you, Mr. Smith,&amp;quot; replied
the landlady, also as usual. &amp;quot;And I 'ope it won't rain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith paused before making his customary comment.
As a rule he said &amp;quot;I trust not,&amp;quot; but this morning the words
refused to come as they had always come before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; — to-day,&amp;quot; he heard himself saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the door slammed behind him as he said it. He heard
the bang. He was not sure whether Miss Slumbubble had
caught his words or not. He laughed to himself. He pulled
at his moustache. Usually, it felt soft, but now, he noticed, it
felt stiff and wiry. It bristled, rather. He laughed again and
set forth briskly to walk across the Park to his office. He had,
after all, forgotten his umbrella. &amp;quot;Something's wrong with
me,&amp;quot; he chuckled to himself, &amp;quot;or — perhaps — it's something
right.&amp;quot; He laughed outright. &amp;quot;Anyhow, it's — &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as he strode along, he suddenly recalled that Miss
Slumbubble had made an unusual remark to him. His mind,
occupied with something else at the moment, had not noticed
it. Now it came back to him. When he said it could not
rain to-day, her comment was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, she would have said that &amp;quot;she oped not.&amp;quot; This
morning she said another thing: &amp;quot;Anything may 'appen,&amp;quot;
were the words she used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything,&amp;quot; agreed Mr. T. Smith, laughing so happily
that, as he crossed Bayswater Road into the Park, he nearly
got run over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ii"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the routine of years, he strolled across the Park,
intending to take a 'bus eventually at Trafalgar Square. But
to-day he felt a strange reluctance to go to his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fought against this, for what would people say if Mr.
T. Smith was late? He had never been late. His reputation
was based upon his punctuality. His clients would talk. Even
Miss Slumbubble might hear of it. It would never do if he
dawdled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bother Miss Slumbubble!&amp;quot; he suddenly exclaimed.
&amp;quot;And hang my clients! What does it matter if I am late!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the way something was singing in his heart. Perhaps
it was that the spring was running in his blood. For now, at
last, the spring had really come. Late in May the sun had finally
struggled out, and the endless winter seemed to be gone for
good. He saw a swallow darting past a chimney. A whiff of
warm, scented air blew over him. He thought of gorse and
pine trees on some sandy waste … of lizards …
butterflies. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew suddenly that it was something more than the
spring. His whole being thrilled to a new rhythm. Someone —
somewhere — had piped and he had heard. The real
man had answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court, but the other one —
Tornado Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For he now abruptly remembered that he was named
Tornado. Mr. T. Smith, most people thought, was Thomas
Smith, even Timothy Smith, but actually his first name was
Tornado. And surely he was not called Tornado for nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the half-named Tornado that heard the queer piping
and answered to it, the part of him that, against all judgment
and reason, drove his little sailing boat out of the safety of the
harbour into the wintry gales of his brief holidays — Tornado,
the adventurer that underlay the man of business, the part
of him that took wild, even ridiculous, risks from time to time.
It was just this &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; belonging to &amp;quot;Tornado,&amp;quot; that
made him different from the jostling thousands he passed daily
on his trudge to his office in the City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some spring, some bubble, danced now in his heart, discovered first,
it seemed, in sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His steps, unconsciously, became slower and slower. He
found himself regretting that he could name no valid excuse
for not turning up at the office. At every opportunity he paused
and looked about him. He studied the shop windows with the
closest attention, as if he had never seen them before — anything
to prolong his walk. He was waiting for something. But what
that &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; was he had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Tornado&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he repeated to himself with a new feeling of
its significance. As though his father had been a whirlwind,
his mother a storm. It made him laugh, as he dawdled on,
staring at this and that, idling, drifting, waiting …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was not till he had reached Trafalgar Square that
he came definitely to a halt. The office seemed suddenly more
than he could bear. He stopped dead. Something plucked
at his heart. He watched the pigeons drinking at the fountains.
He was very late already. He knew quite well that his secretary,
with a bundle of tiresome letters, was fuming and fussing; clients
were wondering why Mr. T. Smith was late. The telephone
was ringing … ringing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, let it ring!&amp;quot; he thought to himself. &amp;quot;And let the
secretary wait! And let the clients wonder why I'm late!
It'll do them all good!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lingered in the warm sunshine, watching the pigeons
preen themselves after their bath, or carrying on the love affairs
that the sudden spell of fine weather provoked. The London
sparrows, even the flies, detained him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He caught himself wondering why he still lived in London.
He had already made a good deal of money, enough to retire on.
Why did he still waste what remained of his early manhood in
this hateful way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were there not other lands that he could visit, lands with
blue skies and sparkling seas? Countries free from the bugbear
of what men called &amp;quot;progress,&amp;quot; more primitive, perhaps, yet
at the same time more peaceful? Places where people still
sang at their work in the hot sunshine … ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought of all he had read about the lotus-lands of the
East and of scattered isles in the Pacific, of coral reefs and
golden strands. It was difficult to believe all the stories he
had read about such places, though he remembered the strange
chill the reading had given him at the time. There ought to
be, there must be, he felt, countries just like that, countries
where things happened, countries where the inhabitants did
more than merely catch 'buses and run for electric trains. He
recalled the sunny, golden advertisements he had read, the
travel-folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he tried in his mind to decide if there was any place
that absolutely fulfilled his requirements. He felt a little
doubtful. Nothing short of a real fairyland would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time he stood thus, gazing into the shimmering
fountain, but he no longer saw the water where the dirty pigeons
bathed. He saw the long line of a coral reef with the great
combers breaking over it in silvery foam against a background
of waving coconut palms on some enchanted island of the
Southern Seas. Soft winds brushed his cheeks. He heard the
sea-birds cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimly he became aware that a small boy was standing
beside him, gazing up into his face with large dark eyes. It was
these enquiring eyes that first arrested his attention, for they
shared, it seemed, his own vision, and saw what he saw. They
were looking, surely, at something the others did not see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the boy, at the first glance, seemed commonplace
enough — like hundreds of others one saw pouring out of school
in a back street. Poorly clad, with a thin, half-starved body,
there was nothing about him the least attractive. On the
second glance, however, Tornado saw that there was a difference.
His features were finer than those of the average slum child.
In spite of his poor clothes, he carried himself with a certain
air, a kind of unconscious grace that suggested some wild animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. T. Smith of Capel Court found himself staring at him —
as a dog or other wild creature stares — full of interest, curiosity,
wonder, all of them spontaneous and unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Buy a ticket, sir,&amp;quot; said the boy in a pleasant, piping
voice. &amp;quot;They're only a shilling.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But where can I go — in these days — for a shilling?&amp;quot;
Tornado asked, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All the way,&amp;quot; the boy answered gravely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;All the way&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; echoed Tornado doubtfully, his heart
beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw that the boy actually held pieces of blue paper in
his hand that looked like tickets. The sight troubled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; he stammered, &amp;quot;of course, I will.&amp;quot; He tried
to look as if he were amused, while actually a lump rose somewhere
in his throat, as he handed the boy a shilling and took
the blue strip of paper in exchange. His hand was shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little fellow turned to go, then stopped suddenly and
came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful never to lose it, Tornado,&amp;quot; he said shyly. &amp;quot;Full
directions are written on the back.&amp;quot; And he turned away a
second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But — how do you know my name?&amp;quot; enquired Tornado,
trembling now all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange boy smiled up into his face. It was an entrancing
smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, we know our customers,&amp;quot; he said softly. &amp;quot;They are
so few.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don't sell many then?&amp;quot; began Tornado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the boy was really gone. It almost seemed as
if he had vanished. He melted away so quickly into the passing
throng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado looked at the blue slip of paper in his hand. On
the back, sure enough, were some lines of writing. The thin,
spidery letters were queer looking, and, instead of ink, some
silvery liquid had been used. But the directions, once he
mastered the script, were plain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Be at the Robin Hood Gate at Richmond Park before noon,&amp;quot;
he read, &amp;quot;and there you will see a girl knitting beneath an
oak tree with a cat beside her. Show her this paper and she
will put you on your way.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="iii"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time Tornado turned the paper over and over in
his hand. Of course, it was all nonsense. It was some charity
stunt, some treasure hunt organised to get money for a hospital.
It was one of these modern tricks that extort money out of the
sentimental crowd … And yet the whole thing fell in
so well with his idle mood that it provided just the excuse he
needed — not to go to his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will go,&amp;quot; he informed himself, rather like a truant boy,
&amp;quot;for the park will be lovely, and there may be somebody there!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back afterwards, Tornado often thought that the
strangest thing about this strange business was that, the moment
he decided to go, no further thought of his neglected work, of
his office, or even of his old life, ever crossed his mind. It was
as if his normal life had ended suddenly. He seemed to have
begun a new existence, while yet this &amp;quot;new existence&amp;quot; seemed
always to have been &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. It had always been within reach,
only he had never found the way. The old shackles and ties
were now cut through, at any rate, and a new and thrilling
sense of freedom swept over him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had found liberty at last! He felt like a gipsy who
leaves the old familiar camp behind him, knowing that the
entire world is his to roam as he will. His office, his rooms,
Miss Slumbubble, were wiped out as though they never had
existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How he reached Richmond Park he never quite knew. No
memory remains. Whether it was by 'bus or taxi, on foot,
or otherwise, he could not say. It seemed to him sufficient that
he found himself at the Robin Hood Gate in an incredibly short
time. He was simply — there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked about him eagerly, but at first could see no one
that answered in any way to the description on his ticket. The
sun blazed down from a cloudless sky; the trees and grasses
still held the freshness of early spring; the scent of the good
clean earth was in his nostrils. And he drew in deep breaths
of sheer delight at getting away so easily from the noise and
smell of the city. The day was radiant, sparkling. His blood
stirred within him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A park keeper, he noticed, was chatting idly with a nurse
girl, and an occasional car swept along the roadway with a swirl
of dust, yet without a sound. They were like pictures only.
But nowhere could he discover a girl beneath an oak tree with
a cat beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out the blue
ticket, intending to read it over once again, but, even as his
hand closed on it, he became aware that he was looking straight
at the object of his search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There sat a girl beneath an oak tree, exactly as described,
and a black cat was licking its paws beside her. He gazed.
A moment before the spot was empty. Yet no surprise stirred
in him. This, somehow, was just what he expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was excited, but not troubled. A flicker of nerves,
however, it seems, ran through him, for he dropped his ticket,
and as it fluttered down and he stooped hurriedly to recover
it, the girl and cat both vanished too. He could not be quite
sure, perhaps, being too intent on picking it up again. Yet
it was nowhere to be seen. Only a large green leaf lay at his
feet. He grabbed it instantly — and, sure enough, he again held
the ticket in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, he must have been mistaken about the disappearance
of the girl and cat. There they both were in front of him,
as plain as life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He advanced. The girl watched him coming. She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm glad you found your ticket,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I was
afraid you might have lost it altogether — like the others.&amp;quot;
Her voice was soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do most people lose it?&amp;quot; he found himself asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most, yes,&amp;quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And can you really show me the way?&amp;quot; he went on,
after a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl seemed amused at the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course I can,&amp;quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something within him hesitated and was afraid. He was
afraid of the question he wanted to ask, afraid that the reply
would never satisfy him. He took a gulp of breath. Then he
asked his question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is it to — Fairyland?&amp;quot; came his whisper. Is that
what the ticket means — all the way to Fairyland?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I live there,&amp;quot; replied the girl simply, &amp;quot;and my name is
Chance. My sister, Luck, lives with me,&amp;quot; she added, pointing
to the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But how can a cat be your sister?&amp;quot; Tornado asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl, without answering, looked at the cat, and Tornado,
following her glance, met the full glare of the cat's eyes. He
felt a faint shiver run through him. No further answer seemed
necessary. The eyes that met his own were not the eyes of a
cat, nor of a human being. They were the eyes, he realised
of a spirit — the eyes of something — of someone — who had seen
the birth and death of worlds, yet still lived on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feeling of chill swept over him. Questions that sprang
to his lips died in his throat and remained unuttered. His
breath failed him for some seconds. He stared from one to the
other uncertainly, and for several minutes no one spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an effort, Tornado looked towards the park gates.
To his surprise some subtle change was already at work. The
gates became dim, the nurse girl and the keeper appeared less
distinct. He gazed hard, trying to focus his sight, but a tenuous
veil seemed to have fallen between him and the familiar world
he knew of old. No effort he made could pierce it quite. This
queer soft gauze fell between his sight and what he had always
known as Reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned again to the girl. Change seemed to be at work
in her too. She looked less homely somehow. Her hair, which
he had before described to himself as a washed-out blond, had
deepened in colour; her rather faded blue eyes had lightened
up. It was as if some hidden lamp shone through. She began
to glow, to radiate light. Second by second her beauty increased.
A kind of radiance seemed to surround her like a cloud, and
this light glimmered everywhere through the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado next became aware that in some strange way
he, too, was changing. Slight tremors ran through him from
his head to his feet. He felt that he was altering, adapting
himself in some way to a changed condition of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in him, he felt, was being speeded up in marvellous
fashion, quickened, heightened, swept into higher,
swifter gears. His thoughts now tore through him at intenser
speed. Rapidity was the keynote. Soon, at this pace, he would
pass beyond the need of ordinary thought at all, of thought as
men knew it. A new power was invading him. Already he
seemed beyond the need of speech with his companions. Words,
syllables, were unnecessary, for in some strange way they
answered his unuttered questions. The blood raced through
his veins with a power that seemed strong enough to rend his
body in pieces. The tear and rush were furious. Yet he remained
utterly indifferent. In this new state the loss of his ordinary
bodily sensations, perhaps even of his body too, appeared a
matter too trivial to notice. There were more interesting things
to think of than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the familiar landmarks were already gone. The park
gates, the keeper and the keeper's lodge had long since vanished,
and only the tops of the biggest trees remained above a kind of
whitish mist. Even while he looked these, too, disappeared
with a kind of spiral swirl. The familiar world had faded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found himself upon a sandy path running through long
heather to a lonely sand beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun shone brightly on the sparkling water, and far
away he could just make out the dim shape of an island. Gulls
wheeled about the shore, and a heron, on lazy wing, passed
circling over his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked round for his companions. The cat had gone,
and in its place stood a dark and lovely girl. Her sister, the
fair one, stood beside her, smiling gravely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may call us Chance and Luck,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;for thus
are we known among men. But these are only names. Others
call us Fate and Destiny, though these, too, are wrong. In
reality there is only the Deed and the Payment.&amp;quot; She paused
and gazed into his eyes. &amp;quot;Perhaps, this is too hard for you,&amp;quot;
she went on gently, &amp;quot;but, if so, Merlin will explain, for he is the
wisest of those who dwell in Fairyland.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="iv"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IV.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado was in no mood to quibble about names, or as to
what Chance meant by her talk of Merlin. He felt a new life
pulsing through his veins, and his heart sang with happiness.
He noted, almost without astonishment, that he had shed his
old clothes somewhere on the journey, his usual City clothes.
Now he stood clad only in a leather jerkin with bare and sunburnt
legs, and instead of shoes he wore rough sandals of deer's hide.
A long hunting knife swung at his belt. Only one thing was
missing, a familiar thing that ought to have been there too.
What it was he could not say. He recognised its absence —
no more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted these changes without surprise, but at the
same time there came a fugitive flash of memory — a memory
of a dream, perhaps, that had come to him only last night.
Dreams have this way of cropping up in stray fragments
sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Miss — er — Slum —&amp;quot; he could not get the whole name,
&amp;quot;and that place of torture I was going to in my dreams — a
bell ringing, ringing — letter — lots of letters — Mr. T. Smith — .&amp;quot;
He passed his hand across his eyes in a vague effort to remember —
&amp;quot;dear, dear, what a horrid dream it was — and there's something
I've forgotten — I wonder if — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes caught the figures of the two girls running past
him, and all memory of his dream slipped from his consciousness
in the way dreams always slip away and are forgotten. His
years had fallen from him like the leaves of a tree, and the vigour
of youth was in his blood. Adventure was calling to him with
her deathless voice. Laughing, he ran down the path to join
his two companions on the edge of the water. He saw their
gleaming white legs as they stepped into a small sailing-boat
lying in the cover, its bow resting on the yellow sand, its stern
just afloat. As he reached them they paused and looked at
him. They leaped back to join him, sitting down on the sand
and motioning to him to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado sat down beside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's the boat that will take you to Fairyland,&amp;quot; said
Chance, smiling at him mischievously. &amp;quot;Have you the courage
to go in her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think so,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;What are the dangers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sisters whispered together for a moment. It was
Luck who answered him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is the danger of never getting back,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;of
never returning. It takes courage, too, to cross the Dragon
Field to get to your home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My home!&amp;quot; he exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at him encouragingly, they laughed, and their
laughter, he thought, was like the music of bells coming faintly,
sweetly across summer meadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your home, yes,&amp;quot; explained Chance. &amp;quot;Hasn't your home
always been here? Haven't you yourself made it here? Through
all the dull years, haven't you dreamed of a little house on the
edge of the forest, near a pool where the deer come down to
drink at nightfall? And a glade where the stags roar when the
autumn leaves are falling? And a sailing boat that will take
you far away to some enchanted isle? And a girl, perhaps,
with dark hair or with blond, and smiling eyes and happy
laughter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew it was all too true. For years and years, all
through his life, he had dreamed such things. From boyhood
he had dreamed of fords where knights-errant held the crossings
against all comers. Sometimes in his dreams he had seen a
battlemented town gay with flags, with strange old-world houses
and narrow, twisting streets. Time after time he had seen the
same town, so that in the end it had become as familiar to him
as his own small bit of London. He could find his way about it
quite well. He knew where the armourer had his shop and where
the leather-workers lived. Even the faces of the people who
kept the market stalls in the quaint little square by the church
were all familiar. Yet he was never quite sure of his own standing
in the town. Even in his dreams he was a little puzzled. Some
of the people saw and recognised him, but others completely
ignored him as though he was not there. All the same, he felt
that it was his own town in a sense. He knew it all, from the
archery butts to the tilting ground, where brave tournaments
were held with the splintering of lances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at his two companions. He saw that they read
his thoughts, and that there was no need of explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell me, please, about the Dragon Field,&amp;quot; he said, a queer
trembling shyness in him. &amp;quot;Are they dangerous?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They are terrifying,&amp;quot; said Luck. &amp;quot;You see, they are the
Guardians, and they don't let everybody by. They will not
touch you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whom do they stop?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck reflected a moment. &amp;quot;Oh, quite a lot of people,&amp;quot;
she replied presently. &amp;quot;Those who are cruel to animals and
children chiefly. Then money-grubbers and gluttons, the kind
that are always thinking of their comfort and their clothes and
their looks. Fat people, too, with shiny skins. You know the sort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado sighed. &amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; he agreed, &amp;quot;it would never
do to let them in. They would make the place impossible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And people who never, never take any sort of risk?&amp;quot; Luck
added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah!&amp;quot; said Tornado to himself, and fell to thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that Fairyland that I see over there?&amp;quot; he asked after
a while, pointing to a misty island far away. He had noticed
it when he first arrived at the beach. Very dim and distant
it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck's expression and voice were graver as she answered.
&amp;quot;You would find it difficult to land there,&amp;quot; she told him. &amp;quot;That
is called Hi Bresil by some, by others the Isle of Avalon. The
souls of those who perish on some high adventure go there.
It is where King Arthur went to rest after his last battle and
before he came back to take possession of his two kingdoms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;His two kingdoms?&amp;quot; Tornado exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; replied Luck, &amp;quot;for does he not reign for ever in the
hearts of the young — and in Fairyland?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned and looked at her sister, exchanging an understanding
smile, then turned back to Tornado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And now we must leave you,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;There is your
boat. Follow that gull with the black patch on his wing, and
he will guide you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sisters drew aside and waited, and though Tornado
could have gone on talking with them for ever, he realised by
the tone of the girl's voice, as also by the smile he had seen on
both their faces, that it was time for him to go. He, at any
rate, was not one of those who never take a risk, he tried to
assure himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got into the boat and stepped the mast. A light wind
had sprung up, blowing off the land. He said good-bye to the
two girls and pushed off boldly. He set the sail. Gaily the
little craft slid through the water towards its strange and distant
goal, as, looking back, he saw Luck and Chance still standing
on the yellow beach, side by side, watching him. He waved his
hand and they waved back. A moment later, when he turned
again, he saw them turn and walk away inland till they disappeared
among the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gull flew steadily ahead, occasionally soaring high up
into the blue, at other times diving down and lightly skimming
the tops of the waves. Sometimes it flew round and round the
boat for a few moments, passing close to Tornado's head and
peering into his face with its bright peeping eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind increased the farther he left the shore, and
Tornado found that his little boat was really travelling quite
fast through the water. He soon lost sight of land, and only
the misty shores of Hi Bresil were visible far ahead. He must
have sailed like this for some hours before he discerned a dark
spot on the horizon. The wind was rising all this time, and his
boat seemed to travel ever faster and faster, leaping from wave
to wave like a thing possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past hour or two he had been afraid of driving
her under and had cased her occasionally, but seeing how bravely
she sailed he now let her have her head, comforting himself
with the thought that she was a magic boat in any case and
ought to know how to keep afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land drew nearer. He was now rapidly getting near
enough to distinguish details. Tall hills, he saw, rose inland,
but close along the shore the ground seemed to be flat and
wooded. He could see no signs of houses or inhabitants. The
coast appeared utterly deserted. But it was also an iron-bound
coast. Great rocks jutted out into the sea and the waves broke
white over them. The flat portions of the shore, he now saw,
were few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked impossible for a small boat to make the land;
but Tornado, with blind faith in the gull, followed where it led —
straight in towards the rocks. Once or twice, he noticed, the
bird turned its head quickly as though to reassure him. Nearer
and nearer they came, and though he felt a little sick with fear,
there was no turning back now. The roar of the surf thundered
all round him, the spray wet his face, and the boat felt the surge
of the great combers as they hurled themselves over the jagged
rocks. He held his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last moment, when everything seemed lost, a narrow
channel opened suddenly before him, and the little boat swept
through between the dangerous rocky walls into a tiny cove.
Once inside, all was quiet. The wind, shut off by the high walls
all round, hardly rippled the surface of the blue water which
lapped peacefully along the narrow sandy bay. And, to his
surprise, he saw that there was actually a little pier made of
rough slabs of stone, with a ring of twisted withies to which he
could fasten his boat. A moment later he had tied her up and
leapt ashore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gull, as if satisfied that its job was done, flew several
times round his head, screaming shrilly as though to say goodbye,
and then headed straight out to sea. Tornado waved his
hand in farewell. He fancied he saw it flirt its wing with the
black spot by way of answer. He watched it disappear into the
blaze of sunshine above the wide blue sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="v"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;V.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado stood still for some time, taking stock of his surroundings.
There seemed to be a footpath from the pier that
led directly into the forest. It lost itself at once among the
dense trees. After examining the ground in all directions this
path appeared the only way he could go, for the shore revealed
no openings, and behind him was, of course, the open sea, His
best, his only, plan was to follow where it led, since it must, at
any rate, lead somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now for the dragons!&amp;quot; he thought uneasily, as a wave
of misgiving swept over him. Instinctively, as he started, he
loosened the long hunting knife at his belt, although he knew
quite well that it would be useless against a dragon that really
meant business. The undoubted fact that he was taking a
risk pleased him nevertheless; it proved him worthy of being
admitted to Hi Bresil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he went cautiously along, keeping his eyes on both sides
and in front as well, the trees grew thicker and thicker, larger
and larger, so that at last he appeared to be walking in a kind
of green tunnel, the branches meeting above his head. Here
and there a splash of sunlight stole through and turned some
strange flower by the path into a flaming jewel. His feet made
no sound on the mossy ground. Silent as the grave the forest
was, for no wind stirred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite suddenly, the path led into the open, the trees fell
away, and a large clearing lay before him. Deer were grazing
quietly all over it. Tornado stiffened like a dog scenting
game and almost unconsciously slipped behind a tree to
watch them. There were red deer and fallow, here and there
an occasional roe, while in the distance he saw other deer
that were quite strange to him. But, as his eyes swept the
herds, picking out the best beasts in each, his attention was
suddenly held by the sight of another animal altogether, and a
very weird one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was lying down when he first saw it, but, as he watched,
it rose slowly and stretched itself. Larger than a stag, he noticed,
and coloured like a rocking-horse, dappled black and white,
There was no mistaking what it was when he saw the long straight
horn coming out of the forehead. He caught his breath. It
was the unicorn. Its eyes gazed gently about it, as though,
without being alarmed, it somehow knew that a stranger was
in its neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What a gracious, splendid creature!&amp;quot; he exclaimed to
himself as he gazed, and a thrill ran through him, for he knew
that the unicorn roams no other pastures save those of Fairyland,
and that he had, therefore, really arrived,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He must have stood behind his tree for a long time watching
the stately creature, his eyes wandering towards the deer as
well, for he had quite forgotten the matter of dragons being
possibly in the neighbourhood, when there came a sudden roaring
in the sky, and Tornado, quickly looking up, saw six dark shapes
rushing downwards at tremendous speed towards the forest;
indeed, towards the very clearing at whose edge he stood concealed.
What looked like jets of flame preceded them, issuing,
apparently, from their mouths. They made a curious loud
rattling sound, with other noises that were half hooting and
half growling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bless my soul!&amp;quot; he exclaimed. &amp;quot;The dragons!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock to his mind and nerves was very considerable,
yet his interest was so intense that his fear was not more than
he could manage. It was odd, however, that just at this very
moment when his entire attention should have been occupied
with this arresting sight, he found time to think of something
else, &lt;em&gt;viz.&lt;/em&gt;, that he had forgotten something. This certainty
that some familiar object was missing came back again. His
hand flew to his knife, but the knife was in its place. There
was another thing he ought to have had with him, only for
the life of him he could not remember what it was. It was
something he always carried. He used it for protection overhead.
What it was, however, he could not imagine. He had
not got it — that was all he knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought flashed through his mind, then vanished
utterly — and he concentrated all his attention again on the
dragons. They were much lower now, just above the tree-tops,
in fact, and one by one he saw them plane down into the clearing
and settle among the feeding deer as quietly as though they
were so many crows. The deer, too, seemed undisturbed by
their arrival, moving calmly to one side to give them room to
land. The unicorn went on rubbing its horn against a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only they were most certainly not crows. The jets of flame
that had poured out of their nostrils while they were in full
flight had died down, but a red glow showed when they opened
their tremendous mouths, while thin wisps of smoke curled
round their jagged lips and floated upwards into the still air.
Their huge sides rose and fell as they breathed, accompanied
by an odd noise, half rattling, half clanking, that was almost
metallic, and came, it seemed, from their interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado now felt really frightened. The appearance of
these monstrous brutes was chilling to the blood. Any one of
them could have swallowed him at a single gulp; their fiery
breath could burn him to an ash in a moment; a blow from a
single tail — and he would be reduced to a pulp of broken bones
and flesh. They were covered, he saw, with bright green scales
which gave out a clashing sound as they moved, Their legs and
claws were a brilliant scarlet, while their eyes, as large as soup
plates, glowed with alternate red and green as though lit by
some internal fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On landing they had folded their wings, which towered
above their backs fully thirty feet into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stared and stared, and the more he stared the less he
liked them. He realised that their arrival coincided too accurately
with his own; they arrived because he had arrived. The
whole six of them, he noticed, had drawn themselves up directly
opposite to where he hid behind his tree, and the path he had
been following, the only path there was, ran right through the
middle of them. They had arranged themselves with military
precision, three on each side of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peering cautiously round the trunk that sheltered him,
he noticed these details, And his heart sank into his deerskin
sandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet his profound trust in what Luck and Chance had told
him did not waver. So far, he reflected, he had come safely
owing to their guidance. He realised he must trust them to
the end, or else fail to prove himself worthy of his quest. His
muscles, however, were like paper in his legs. He dared not,
could not, move — when, suddenly, he heard a far, shrill cry,
and, looking up, he saw the gull with the spotted wing in the
air above the trees. It circled once, peeped down at him,
uttered its shrill cry a second time, and vanished into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this that decided him to act. Summoning up all his
courage, he took the risk. He stepped out from behind his
tree and walked slowly but steadily forwards in the direction
of the waiting dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearer he drew to them the less he liked it. His blood
was water. He trembled. But he walked fairly straight,
giving no outward sign of flinching. Only a few yards now
separated him from the first couple in the dreadful row, and
he realised that there was only just room to pass between them
without actually touching. The slightest stumble, leaning an
inch to right or left, would mean that he would brush the awful
jaws. Indeed, as he moved slowly forward, the dragon on the
right yawned widely, showing an enormous mouth with huge
pointed teeth and a red tongue that flickered in and out with
a ghastly significance. It was licking its great lips, of course.
But the behaviour of its companion facing it on the left seemed
even more ominous, for its immense tail began to twitch and
swing from side to side like the tail of a cat before it springs.
It seemed to be gathering its vast legs under it as a kitten does
when it leaps playfully at a ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado felt himself as the ball. His body dripped with
perspiration. His legs only just supported him. But he still
kept moving with slow steps forward, nearer and ever nearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last he was actually between the first pair of mighty
heads. The creatures eyed him, but did not move. He passed
slowly onwards. He reached the second pair, whose eyes
similarly followed him, the bodies keeping motionless. A
whiff of burning brimstone came to his nostrils, blended,
he fancied, with another smell that was curiously familiar,
though he could not name it. He knew the name, but it
had vanished with another part of his life which, equally, was
forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dragons, as he passed further between four more pairs
of heads, never moved, though following him steadily with
their fiery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When half way down the line Tornado only just controlled
a violent impulse to make a sudden run for it. It occurred to
him to dash wildly forward as fast as ever he could sprint — and
trust to luck. But as the idea took form in his mind, the words
&amp;quot;trust to Luck&amp;quot; brought the quick knowledge that to carry
out his plan would betray cowardice and failure. To trust to
Luck and Chance was not to run away. There was Destiny.
And Destiny, though implacable, obeyed courage and determination.
He held on his dreadful way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the end came, at last, without disaster. He passed
the final pair of monsters safely. Not one of the dragons had
moved. Now that he was beyond them, though only a few
feet, they still crouched unmoved upon the forest sward. Joy!
He had not failed himself! He had proved worthy of the
heritage of Hi Bresil, if only by the skin of his teeth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying not to break into a run, Tornado, his breath irregular,
his heart thumping like a little drum, followed the path. The
unicorn came close, lowered its stately head, and nuzzled his
shoulder with its dangerous pointed horn. He looked a moment
into its gentle eyes. The herds of deer divided quietly to let
him pass, then fell to feeding again, quite undisturbed. In
fact, he had to wait once while a large company of them crossed
in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had not looked back as yet, but now he heard suddenly
a tremendous rattling clatter, a hissing and a hooting, and,
turning his head, he saw the great dragons take the air. It
was a wondrous sight. They rose without effort, snorting fire
and smoke, their scales making a din of clanking metal, and,
once above the trees, he saw the whole six pass across the sky
in a wedge-shape formation like a skein of monstrous geese.
They became smaller and smaller as they rose into upper space,
their roaring died away, they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the deer nor the unicorn, he noticed, paid the
slightest attention to this great commotion. Silence and peace
descended again upon the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vi"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VI.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado drew a deep breath and felt happier than ever in
his life before. Such happiness seemed incredible, yet he experienced
it. He was coming closer and closer to something he
had always yearned for. He longed to wait a while and make
closer friends with the attractive unicorn, but some instinct
warned him that he must not linger, but should push on farther,
for the climax of what he sought lay yet in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had now reached the far side of the clearing. The sun
was sinking, the shadows growing longer. He began to think
vaguely about food, about where and how he was going to sleep
as well. He was not tired, but sleep when the sun went down
seemed natural. Should he lie down on the moss and ferns?
Should he look about for berries? The music of a tinkling
stream reminded him that he was thirsty. He knelt down and
drank his fill of sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he rose to his feet again the forest, it seemed, wore
another look. It was not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same as when he knelt down
a minute ago. He gazed about him. There was a certain
curious change, he fancied. He felt he had seen it before. The
fringe of the woods he was now approaching wore almost a
familiar guise. This old impression grew stronger as he walked
slowly on. The path, unless he was mistaken, would presently
take a sharp turn to the left just beyond that old gnarled oak
tree. There would be a cottage with a pool of water beside it.
He would go up and knock on the door, and the door would
open …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, it proved exactly as he imagined. Leaving
the forest, the path turned sharply to the left. There stood the
cottage, the cottage of his desires, and the pool that he had
loved so long in dream. And that figure among the sunflowers,
was it Luck or Chance? He could not quite see. It disappeared
behind the rows of sunflowers where he saw the unicorn gazing
gently at him over the towering foxgloves. It was coming in
by the way back, of course, to open to him. His heart rose
triumphantly within him. He wanted to shout and sing. He
had at last come — Home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tornado, his blood pulsing with this happiness, strode
boldly up to the door. He knocked confidently. He stood
waiting a moment. No one came at first. He knocked again,
but still no one came; there was no sound of a footfall. A
vague feeling of disquietude stole over him. Ah! there was
another way of getting in, he seemed to remember, and his hand
went automatically down the side of his leg as if hunting for
something he expected to find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a pocket he sought? His pocket, at any rate, was
there as usual. The thing he looked for, too, lay hard and
firm inside it. He drew out his key and inserted it without
effort in the lock. The door opened easily as usual. He went
in, also as usual. There before him stood his girl-secretary, a
pile of letters behind her on the desk, again as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bell was ringing impatiently, ringing, ringing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl's face wore a half reproachful look as she bade him
respectfully good morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A little late, am I … ?&amp;quot; offered Mr. T. Smith, a
trifle apologetically. &amp;quot;I — er — walked the whole way, I'm
afraid. The morning,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;was so fine, you know … &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, Mr. Smith,&amp;quot; replied the girl. &amp;quot;A pity it's clouded
over since.&amp;quot; She turned away to answer the telephone, which
kept on ringing, ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as she said the words he noticed that the first early
brilliance indeed had passed. The sky outside was dark and
lowering. Rain obviously threatened. The girl was gabbling
at the telephone. He waited, listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Miss Slumbubble, sir,&amp;quot; she reported, laying the receiver
down. &amp;quot;To say you forgot your umbrella. She's sending it at
once by messenger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh — ah — yes,&amp;quot; he murmured vaguely. &amp;quot;I — knew I had
forgotten — something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced at his watch. After all, he was only fifteen
minutes late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps another fifteen minutes had passed when a
small messenger boy arrived with his umbrella, offering a piece
of blue paper which Mr. T. Smith signed by way of receipt,
having first paid the little bright-eyed lad a shilling. He signed,
without thinking, &amp;quot;Tornado Smith.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;by Algernon Blackwood (1928)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Illustration from the original publication." src="/blog-en/img/algernon-blackwood_when-nick-dressed-up/algernon-blackwood_when-nick-dressed-up.jpg" style="width: 25em;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick, with the red hair, had been naughty. How naughty is
not known, but it must have been pretty bad, for the governess called
him &amp;quot;Nicholas,&amp;quot; and sent him to his room for the rest of the afternoon.
Instead of going out to play in the sunshine he was to stay indoors
alone. She locked him in too. He heard her footsteps going down
the passage. They died away. Downstairs, in the depth of the silent
house, they presently ceased altogether. He was alone. He began
to look about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room he was locked up in was not really his own bedroom,
it was a box-room. Boxes of every sort and kind stood piled up
against the walls. In the slanting roof was a large skylight window
that let the light in, and the first thing Nick did was to drag an
empty packing-case and climb up so that he could peep out. Being
nine years old and rather tall for his age, he could just manage
it. He poked his nose over the edge and stared down at the garden
in the sunshine, and saw the governess walking across the lawn with
a big book under her arm. She was going towards the summer-house,
where the gardener was mowing the grass with the fat Shetland pony.
He watched her. Five minutes later she was deep in her book, lying
full length in a deck-chair. Ten minutes later he saw the book slip
to the ground. She was asleep. Nick scrambled back on to the floor.
&amp;quot;Ha! Ha!&amp;quot; he said to himself, and clicked his tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the fact of her being asleep that somehow suggested to
him the idea of escaping. She wouldn't hear, for one thing; for
another, she wouldn't see. He went over and tried the door. It
was really locked. He shook it till it rattled, when suddenly, to his
surprise and delight, the key shook loose and fell with a clatter to the
floor. It made such a noise, however, that he was afraid she must
have heard it even across the lawn. So he climbed up again on his
packing-case to look. No! She was still asleep. He almost fancied
he could hear her snore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just as he was carefully climbing down again, a strange
thing happened. Right under his nose it happened. He saw a mouse
run over the floor. He stared. He watched it. He said &amp;quot;Hist!
Hist!&amp;quot; It darted first one way, then another. It was hunting for
its hole, terrified of the big human figure in the air above it. He leaped
down to chase it. The same second it vanished. It had escaped, but
not into its hole. It had run &lt;em&gt;under the door&lt;/em&gt;. The old door fitted
badly. There was a crack between it and the floor. &amp;quot;Ho! Ho!&amp;quot;
said the boy to himself, and clicked his tongue again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick was on his hands and knees in a moment. He could see
the key lying on the landing just outside. With the help of a long
nail he found loose in the wall he could just reach it. In a very short
space of time the key was under the crack and in his hand. Two
seconds later the door was unlocked and Nick was free! &amp;quot;Good
little mouse!&amp;quot; he said to himself in a whisper. &amp;quot;I believe you
showed me the way on purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do next was the question now. After thinking things
over for a minute or two, he then locked himself in. He did this
with a reason. He had an idea, this naughty Nick. He meant to
escape, of course, but his idea was first to disguise himself, so that if
anybody met him downstairs they wouldn't know who he was. But
he did not want to be interrupted while dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the boxes that gave him this idea of disguise, and he began
his search at once. Nick was not the kind to waste time. Besides,
the governess might wake up and climb the stairs to see if he was
still there. In less than ten minutes every box that would open was
open, their contents littered all over the floor. Nick scratched his
red head and stared at the collection, wondering what was best to
wear, wondering also what would fit him. His safety depended on
his choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a problem: the dusty floor was covered with garments
of every description — from Wellington boots his father sometimes
wore, to uniforms, fur coats in camphor, gun-cases, rugs, shawls,
blankets, and a lot of female clothes he could not name at all. He
examined them one by one, scratching his head and sighing. There
seemed nothing he could use. The smell of camphor was quite
sickly. Slowly, with disappointment in his heart, he began to put
them back into their various boxes, when suddenly something shining
caught his eye. It gleamed, it was white, it was pointed, it was — yes,
it was — a tooth. More — it was a row of teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked it up gingerly, and an animal head and muzzle came
up with it from the pile. A whole skin followed. He held his breath
and stared, for it seemed he recognized it. He stared again. He did
recognize it. It was the pantomime bear-skin his father used to put
on at Christmas when the children were quite small, and when Father,
too, was smaller than he was now. He had grown too big for it;
the children, Nick among them, had also grown too big for such
nonsense. But it was a wonderful bear-skin. You could get inside
it, head and all, and there was something you squeezed like a bulb
so that it made a noise that sounded as if a bear was growling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later Nick was inside it, practising. It fitted him
fairly well, though the tail and shoulders dragged a little. He stuffed
some shawls in to make it fuller. The growl, when he squeezed the
bulb, was like a motor-car before it starts. He could walk about in
it, he could stretch his arms, he could open and shut the mouth
with the great white gleaming teeth, and when he pressed the bulb
and growled he felt exactly as if he was a real bear. There were narrow
slits below the eyes he could see through. The disguise was perfect.
No one could possibly recognize him. &amp;quot;Hee! Hee!&amp;quot; he said to
himself excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing was — where to go; but before that he must
make sure the governess was still asleep, or at least still in the summer-house.
So, slipping his head free, he clambered up once more to the
skylight window and peered over the edge. To his horror, he saw
that she was no longer in the deck-chair; the summer-house was
empty. She must be in the house below, on her way, perhaps, to
come and let him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same moment he caught the sound of a footstep on the
stairs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-headed boys, especially naughty red-headed boys, think
quickly. His mind was made up in a second. He sprang down,
darted out on to the landing as rapidly as the great skin allowed,
shut the door and locked it, and then stood motionless against the
wall, waiting for her to come up. He hoped she would think it was
a stuffed bear — there were two stuffed bears in the hall below — standing on
its hind legs. He kept still as a mouse, holding his arms out
like the bears in the hall. And the steps came slowly, slowly nearer.
Peeping through the narrow slits he could see clearly. It was the
governess. She reached the top stair, passed him so close that she
actually touched him, unlocked the door, and walked inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick held his breath, not daring to turn his head; but he knew
she was looking round the box-room to find him. She had not noticed
the &amp;quot;stuffed bear&amp;quot; evidently, because she was so accustomed to the
couple in the hall. If she noticed it at all, she thought this was just
an extra one that was kept upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas, where are you?&amp;quot; he heard. &amp;quot;If you are good now,
and will say you're sorry, you may come out!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no answer. He heard her move forward into the
room. The light was dim, for it was drawing towards evening and
shadows lay thickly in the corners. The landing, too, where he stood
was rather dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas! Do you hear me?&amp;quot; came in a louder voice. There
was still, of course, no answer. Slowly, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slowly, Nick turned his
head. He could see her searching for him, rummaging among the
piled-up boxes. He had put all the things back in their places again,
and there was no sign of disorder. He watched her. She was stooping
down now, peering behind a great packing-case, calling out,
&amp;quot;Nicholas! Nicholas! Come out at once!&amp;quot; when he suddenly
bent over, put his terrible head round the corner, pressed the bulb,
and swung his arms about in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governess turned, saw the great bear behind her, heard its
awful growl, opened her mouth, screamed, and fell back against the
wall, knocking a large hamper over as she did so. The noise and
clatter were tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Help! Help! Murder!&amp;quot; screamed the governess at the top
of her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nick did not wait to help. He knew she would recover in
a moment. She was only startled, really. Kicking the door to with
a hind leg, he turned and ran downstairs as fast as ever he could go.
He heard the door bang behind him, but the next minute, and before
he was further than the second landing, he heard it open again, and
out came the frightened governess, still yelling &amp;quot;Help! Help!&amp;quot; and
flopping down the stairs after him as though a murderer were at her
heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she had guessed who the bear was and was chasing
&lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, Nick didn't know; probably she was too frightened to think
of anything except her own safety and was flying to some room
where she could lock herself in and feel secure. Anyhow, she came
thumping down the stairs behind him, only so slowly that he was
down the second flight before she even reached the landing above.
And at the bottom of this second flight, sitting on the tiger rug in
the hall, he now saw Smoke, the fat grey Persian cat. The cat, at the
same time, saw — him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke, as a rule, was too lazy even to play. She was enormously
fat; she never made a quick movement of any sort unless she could
help it. But when she saw this great bear with gleaming teeth come
tumbling headlong down the front stairs into the hall she rose
suddenly, arched her back, stuck her tail like a rod into the air, hissed,
spat, jumped sideways — and was out of the hall as quick as lightning.
She shot through an open door into the drawing-room, where the
French windows stood wide. A second later she was scampering
across the lawn as though a dozen terriers were at her heels. And
Nick was following her. He, too, darted into the drawing-room, out
through the windows, and tore across the lawn towards the summer-house.
Into this summer-house Smoke disappeared like some
mysterious shadow. Nick, following a moment later, also disappeared
from view. The governess, having now reached the open drawing-room
windows, looked across the lawn, saw nothing but the
gardener and the pony with the lawn-mower, and, mopping her
face with her handkerchief, turned round and went back into the
house again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly had she turned her back, however, when Nick, finding
the cat behind the box of croquet mallets, produced such an alarming
growl that Smoke, perhaps in play, perhaps in genuine fright, shot
out of the summer-house again like a flash of light, and Nick, the
bear, flashed after her. They emerged almost together, and so suddenly
that neither of them noticed the Shetland pony that was drawing
the lawn-mower at that moment exactly past the opening. The
pony, on the other hand, noticed both of them — a flying cat and a
racing bear — just beneath its nose, at its very feet in fact. And this
unusual sight so alarmed the pony that it flung up its heels, shook
its head violently, and began to kick. It kicked the pile of cut grass
completely upside down, so that the fine stuff flew into the gardener's
face and made him cough and choke. The shower of grass fell all
over him like rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weedon, the gardener, was extremely surprised, for he had
never seen the lazy pony do anything violent before, but a moment
later he had shaken the grass out of his mouth and eyes and quieted
the animal, when, as he turned round, he saw the sight of his life —
a bear chasing a cat into the drawing-room window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I never —!&amp;quot; exclaimed Weedon, wondering if he was
going to be ill — and promptly gave chase himself. The pony, accustomed
to follow him, thought it was expected to do so now, and began
to drag the mower slowly after him towards the house. Just as
Weedon, who was not very fast on his feet, reached the open window,
out shot Smoke, the fat Persian cat, between his legs, the bear after
it again, and following the bear — the governess. There followed a
general collision: Weedon fell backwards into a geranium bed close
to the Shetland pony, who had now reached the edge of the lawn
and was nibbling the flowers; the governess tripped over Weedon
and pitched headlong into a rose bush; the bear stumbled over the
cat and went head over heels along the gravel path. Only the cat
kept its feet. Smoke, tail in air and whiskers bristling, shot on ahead
faster than ever in the direction of the front door of the house, which
now, for some reason, stood open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the pile of people on the ground became gradually
disentangled. Weedon helped the governess to her feet, then
pushed the pony away from the flowers, telling it to behave itself
and not eat geraniums; the bear stood upright, peeping out of its
narrow slits. There was a general puffing and blowing, and the
governess this time did not scream, because she had no breath left
in her lungs. Nick, however, quicker than the others, had seen the
cat's tail disappearing through the open front door, and, before anybody
could say &amp;quot;knife,&amp;quot; was after it. Following him as before, but
much more slowly, came the lumbering Weedon and the unsteady
governess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick reached the door and plunged headlong through it into the
hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the final disaster. For at this very moment Thompson,
the butler, happened to be crossing the hall with a tray, on his
way to the morning-room. Luckily, there was nothing on the tray
but a jug of hot water he was taking to the grown-ups' tea. It was
quite enough, however. The cat flew past his feet like a grey shadow,
but the bear landed full tilt against his middle, upsetting Thompson
himself, the tray, and the jug of hot water. They all fell at the same
moment, with a thundering noise, and it was only five seconds later,
before any of them had time to get up again, that the morning-room
door opened and a stern male voice cried: &amp;quot;What on earth is all
this noise about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Father. He had come in by the back way from riding,
and was just sitting down to his quiet cup of afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he saw, as he stared across the hall, was a sight to be
remembered. Thompson was sitting on the floor, his red face
drenched in water; a bear crouched on all fours beside him, in the
act of getting up; on the mat by the front door stood the governess,
who had just arrived, her hair coming down, her arms waving; and
behind her was Weedon, the gardener, fine-cut grass still clinging
to his hat and neck and shoulders; while, just beyond him, shoving
his head almost against his coat, was the Shetland pony, which had
managed somehow to get loose from the mower and had followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment Father stood and stared. His face at first grew
dark, but then gradually relaxed; the lines about the mouth softened;
a twinkle crept into his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this the Zoological Gardens?&amp;quot; he enquired in his deep
voice, &amp;quot;or is it, perhaps, only a — bear-garden?&amp;quot; And his gaze
rested on the bear, who had now managed to stand upright, facing
him. In these few seconds he had quickly discovered who the chief
culprit was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answer came. Thompson shuffled off to fetch more hot
water from the pantry; Weedon, touching his hat, turned round
and led the pony away from the hall door; the governess, tidying
her hair as best she could, opened her mouth to explain matters, but
found she had no breath. She moved slowly towards the door that
led to the back stairs and disappeared. Only the bear was left. It
was rather a frightened bear, it neither stirred nor growled, it stood
there waiting for what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what have you been up to this time?&amp;quot; said Father,
gruffly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only — dressing up,&amp;quot; came the faint reply from inside the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A dressing down is what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need,&amp;quot; said the gruff voice, and,
caught up in the big arms, the bear was carried bodily into the
morning-room. The dressing down, however, was apparently not a
very painful matter, for a good deal of laughter was heard inside the
room, and when Thompson returned with the hot water he saw Nick's
red head sticking out of the skin, its mouth busy with jam and
bread-and-butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing, at any rate, Nick had to do, and that was to say he
was sorry to everybody he had upset. First to the governess, then
to the butler, then to Weedon, then to the pony, and last of all to
Smoke, the Persian cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Ho!&amp;quot; he said to himself when these apologies were all
over. &amp;quot;It was worth it, anyhow!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Portrait of a man with a lock of  grey hair.." src="/blog-en/img/algernon-blackwood_the-lock-of-grey-hair/algernon-blackwood_the-lock-of-grey-hair.jpg" style="width: 30em;" /&gt;

&lt;!-- “Once upon a time, in a far-off land, malpractice carried an arcane penalty.” --&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hung so conspicuously there amid the
surrounding mop of fine dark hair that
it piqued the curiosity of Dr Blane's
friends more than any other detail of his
very distinguished appearance. Grief,
said a good number, had caused it;
anxiety, declared others; but the majority,
including servants and women
plumped, of course, for love. He was
successful, and he was unmarried; the
evidence was unanswerable. I believe,
however, that I am the only living person
who holds the true secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people who have really lived,”
he used to say, “possess some singular experience
or other that they do not care
about telling indiscriminately. And this
is mine. I'm a little ashamed of it,” he
added, “for nowadays we explain everything--
or confess ourselves unscientific.
Besides”--he shrugged his shoulders--&amp;quot;my
conduct, I always feel, was not strictly
professional perhaps in the best sense.
And, also--it was the only time in my
life when I was obliged to acknowledge
a sense of unreasoning fear--and yield
to it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the story, it must be confessed,
certainly would have claimed belief more
readily in those picturesque times when
“Possession,” diabolical or otherwise, was
a prevalent superstition, and when the
post mortem activity of a disembodied
spirit was held to be often exceedingly
lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened before the days when Dr
Blane's skill had earned for him the
honours of knighthood, together with the
privilege of inspectorship of royal diseases.
This, somewhat, is as he told it to me
shortly before his own death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an intimate friend, it appears, he
was revisiting a little village in the Swiss
Jura, where he had been to learn French
as a boy, when the friend incontinently
was laid low with diphtheria, and he
stayed out perforce to nurse him. Both
men had their meals in the cosy little
Pension de La Poste, where twenty years
before they had studied grammar and
irregular verbs together; but Dr Blane,
who wanted quiet, had his work and bedroom
in Michaud's new house at the other
end of the village where the yards begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the epidemic, it so happened, was
a severe one, and two other persons- — but
for whom this thing might not have come
about- — were also laid low: one, the village
æsculapius, Dr Ducommun; the other,
Mlle. Udriet, a wealthy but avaricious old
woman, whose personality was of dark
and sinister odour throughout the whole
countryside, and who, on account of her
intense miserliness, was known generally
as “la mauvaise riche.” And she was
well named, for village wit has a way of
hitting the nail on the head. She was
an evil woman, with great force of individuality,
dreaded by all; and her fear of
spending money went to amazing lengths.
It was even reported of her that she enticed
her neighbours' cats into her big
house, slew and cooked them with her
own hands, and ate them to save a
butcher's bill. Her long finger-nails, and
certain other unappetising peculiarities,
were evidence, the village held for anything
and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Dr Blane, who was sent for to
prescribe in the temporary absence of Dr
Ducommun, admits that the moment he
crossed the threshold of the ill-smelling
room and saw the old miser staring fixedly
at him from her bed, he was inspired by
an instant and singularly powerful aversion
for her. The face he always described
as truly venomous, and her thin
fingers lying on the coverlet were “taloned
and be-clawed,” he used to declare with
a shuddering laugh, “like the feet of a
great bird of prey.” Here, for the first
time in his life, was a patient, he hinted
afterwards, whom he would rather have
helped to die than to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though ashamed of his revulsion he
could not quite conceal it. The fact that
she would never pay his fees was nothing.
It was the woman herself. &amp;quot;She was like
some great loathsome insect in that dark
room,” he said; &amp;quot;some insect whose sting
was death!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation at first was merely unpleasant,
but a little later it became more
awkward and furnished Dr Blane with
the excuse for what he terms his unprofessional
attitude. For the village doctor
got better--well enough to crawl out
and see his pet patients--and la mauvaise
riche got steadily worse. Moreover, she
insisted on sending for Dr Blane because
she preferred his greater skill, and Dr
Blane as often as possible shelved the
unpleasant responsibility upon the shoulders
of the local practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, he avoided seeing her —
even refused point blank to do so, and the
old woman, when she found that he no
longer came, suffered paroxysms of rage
that were positively terrifying in their
concentrated fury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one night towards the end of
March when the matter came to a climax.
Earlier in the evening Mlle. Udriet, apparently
at her crisis, had sent him an imperious
summons, and Dr Blane, not without
pricks of conscience, had passed on
the summons by messenger to his colleague
at the other end of the village.
Dr Ducommun, however, was delayed for
several hours, with the unfortunate result
that la mauvaise riche lay neglected to
the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Englishman, of course, knew nothing
of this. He was in the Pension
sitting by the bedside of his friend, reading.
It was 10 o'clock. Shaded candles
stood on the little table, and the sick man
was sleeping peacefully the sleep of recovery.
For twenty-four hours there had
been no return of the delirium. At the
end of the darkened room Mme. Favre,
who owned the pension and had proved
herself a devoted helper, was in the act
of mixing a tumbler of the St. Germain
— her invariable remedy for all complaints
— when suddenly two things — two surprising
things — happened simultaneously:
the sick man sat bolt upright in bed with
startling abruptness, stared fixedly into
the dim room in front of him, and
pointed; while Mme. Favre let fall her
tumbler with a crash upon the floor and
cried, in a voice of genuine alarm, “Who
is it? Somebody pushed past me!
There's someone else in the room!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular way these two persons
acted on the same instant impressed Dr
Blane unpleasantly — curiously. He was
conscious at once of a disagreeable thrill
— of something that brought the water
with a rush to his eyes and made the
skin of his back crawl. Yet of course
he never for one moment believed that
anyone had really entered the room
through the closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A return of the delirium,” he said
quietly, as his friend continued to glare
about him and to point. And then added
more sternly, “There's no need for alarm,
Mme. Favre, I assure you;” for the old
lady was leaning, pale and terrified,
against the cupboard, and staring towards
the bed as though her eyes would drop
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the patient, of course, absorbed
his immediate attention. To the doctor
there could be nothing very unusual about
a scene of delirium; yet about this particular
scene of delirium, he became
sharply and unpleasantly aware, there
was something very unusual indeed. It
was convincingly and horribly real. To
begin with, though the sick man had forgotten
his French almost to the simplest
phrases, he was now gabbling the language
with a speed and fluency that were
positively uncanny; and at the same time
with a vehemence, a passion, a fury that
had characterised none of his former attacks;
moreover — most disquieting of all —
with a thin, whispering voice that was beyond
question not his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of the whole wild torrent, all he,
and for that matter all Mme. Favre, could
catch before it subsided again into abrupt
silence were the short phrases, uttered
with eyes fixed upon the doctor and hand
pointing into his very face: “You passed
me by. But now I am out — and I shall
not pass you by!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular thing, however — and it was
this that gave the good woman the &amp;quot;crise
de nerfs&amp;quot; that ended in a fainting fit — the
singular and horrible thing, was that as the
changed voice poured out of the sick man,
his face altered visibly as well, altered too
into the lineaments of another visage that
they both knew. How the eyes and
mouth of a man could slip into the expression
of a woman — an evil, vindictive
woman — is beyond the power of description,
yet the calm, experienced Dr Blane.
as well as the frightened old lady at the end
of the room, both recognised beyond possibility
of discussion that voice, face, and
manner belonged to the evil personality of
that perverted old woman, la mauvaise
riche. In the eyes, perhaps, the resemblance
lay chiefly. It was unmistakable.
It was weirdly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it all passed as quickly as it came.
The sick man slept peacefully once more,
Mme. Favre pulled herself together, assisted
by the judicious aid of cold water,
and half an hour later Dr Blane, battling
already with vivid sensations of alarm
such as he had never known before in his
life, left the pension to go back to his own
rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shortest way lay down the village
street, past the house of Mlle. Udriet,
and so home. Yet the doctor deliberately
chose the longer route. He admits it
frankly. He did not wish to pass the
woman's house. “I was curiously nervous,
almost frightened,” he said: “though
exactly of what I could not tell. I came
out of La Poste into the night all trembling.
It was the most unaccountable sensation
I have ever known. Rather than
pass the door of that woman's house I'd
have walked a mile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he went home by a roundabout way
of perhaps 15 minutes. The village was
utterly deserted, and the night air swept
about him with the scents of early spring
from the surrounding forests. In his mind,
however, he still saw his friend's changed
face and heard the whispered words so
vindictively uttered, “You passed me by.
Now I'm out. I shan't pass you by!”
And do what he might he could not dismiss
them. The words kept time with
the echo of his feet on the hard road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more than halfway his path
joined the main street by the fountain,
and then turned to the right and ran between
low stone walls to Michaud's house.
Beyond the walls were vineyards with hundreds
of bare sticks already planted in the
earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was here, as he passed the fountain,
that he first heard a noise that sent
the blood tingling up about his ears. The
mountain water splashes there all the year
round with a steady fall, but what he
heard had nothing to do with that. It
was the sound of small feet pattering
along under the deep shadow of the
houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was following him. “It's a
dog,” he said, yet at the same time he
knew quite well it was not a dog. It
was on two feet, not on four. Fear dropped
cold and wet over his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road slopes the whole way to where
the Michaud house stands isolated from
the rest of the village among the vineyards,
and Dr Blane quickened his pace
almost to a run. He found the excuse
that it was cold, though he was perfectly
well aware that the cold he felt was not
common cold of night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time he resisted the desire to look
round, but before he was half-way down
the hill the moon emerged from the clouds,
and at last, with a sudden movement as
though he expected to be attacked from behind,
he stopped short, and turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village street in the pale wintry
moonlight was empty. Black shadows
lined its sides; the church pierced the
sky; far above gleamed the spectral snows
on the heights of Mont Racine, and the
great mountain of Boudry with its dark
army of pines hung, immense and forbidding,
in the air. Nothing moved.
But from the spaces of open moonlit road
close behind him came the sound of light
pattering. The steps still followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this creeping fear had begun
to master him was beyond all things
strange. He pulled himself together with
a great effort of will and continued his
way, this time without undue haste; for
to run, he realised, was to admit that
terror was in his heart. Yet, along some
dark by-way, it had undoubtedly established
itself already in his blood beyond
all reach of argument. He walked with
firm and measured steps, and as a result
he at once noticed that the sounds were
no longer audible. The moment he asserted
his will, apparently they ceased.
The whole thing was, of course, imaginary,
born of the night, of the deep wintry
silence, and of the unpleasant memory that
vivid scene in the sickroom had marked
on his brain — in a word, nerves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the village behind him, he entered
the section of road where low walls
separated it from the vineyards on either
side. But before he had gone a dozen
yards he became aware that something
was running stealthily among the serried
ranks of vine sticks over the wall on his
left. The soft pattering on the earth was
distinctly audible. The thing was keeping
pace with him still, yet always a little
behind. It was holding him in view —
watching; waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This,” he says, “I realised above all
else — that I was being followed with some
sinister purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping to the middle of the road, however,
Dr Blane refused now to quicken his
steps. It was remarkable how dead, how
deserted the mountain village seemed. No
one was about; lights were out in every
house. Wind, the night, and the timid
moon with her fugitive gleams held possession
of the world. And those swift,
pattering footsteps, making their way
without a single false tread between thousands
of upright stakes, ran ever beside
him on the other side of the low wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last the outline of the house loomed
welcome before him, and he entered the
iron gates, slowly, still master of himself,
and fumbled in the lock with his key. A
space of gravel path led up to the door,
and as he stooped to insert the key he
was positive that he heard something leap
the wall and land with a kind of hushed
shuffle on the shingly path close behind
him. He turned with an exclamation, half
cry, half curse — again with the instinctive
idea of protecting himself from attack,
when suddenly a light shone through
the door, and Michaud, his landlord,
opened it from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sounds ceased; Dr Blane passed
hurriedly in. Never was light or human
presence more welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'll close after you,” said Michaud, a
little man with a jolly, smiling fat face.
“I knew your step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before shutting the door he peered out
into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tiens!” he said, looking about him,
“I thought I heard someone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's a dog or something that followed
me down the road,” said the doctor. He
was glad to be with another man — uncommonly
glad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud closed the door and locked it,
but as he did so Dr Blane got the curious
impression that something darted in past
his legs like a swift shadow into the house.
At the same moment the lantern standing
on the steps behind fell with a crash,
as though knocked over, and the light
was extinguished. Michaud laughed as
he struck a match to relight it. He
looked rather closely at his lodger for a
moment. Dr Blane declares that to the
end he could never be certain that he
had not himself stumbled against the lantern
and so kicked it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been here several times to
fetch you,” the man said the moment the
door was fastened, “but I told them
you were out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who came?&amp;quot; asked the other with an
odd catch in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't see. I called down from
the window, but didn't recognise the
voice — some woman, I think. It was too
dark to see. I told them to get Dr
Ducommun. She's dead, you know,” he
added abruptly. “Gone to her account
at last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who — who is dead?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaud's voice was curiously hushed
as he replied: “La mauvaise riche.” He
shrugged his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently they said good-night, and Dr
Blane went up to his room to work
or to sleep. They were alone in the
house, these two, for Madame Michaud
was away visiting her mother at La Chaux-
de-Fonds, and there were no other occupants.
He heard the little man thumping
about for a space in his bedroom below.
Then, presently all sounds ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Blane's room was on the top floor —
an attic room really. There were double
windows, a cupboard, a bed in one corner
with a mountainous duvet, hot-air pipes,
a wash-hand stand opposite, and in the
centre his work-table with two lighted
candles. By the bed and table two strips
of carpet — the rest pine boards, not even
stained. It was all very primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he tried to work — in vain.
Then, turning his thoughts inwards, he
deliberately attacked the problem with a
view to solving it and recovering his normal
state of balance. He brought to
bear upon it all the force of his acute
mind, together with his great medical
knowledge and experience. But analysis
only confirmed things: he was suffering
from a singular invasion of utterly unreasoning
fear. He was afraid in the
depths of his soul; cold and perspiring
in turns; horribly creepy about the skin;
and his hair ready at the least sound to
rise upon his head. Yet, in his search,
he could find nothing that seemed an
adequate cause. His neglect of a patient,
not even properly his, he admitted, was
not wholly pardonable, but, after all — !
His mind, in spite of all efforts, came
back always to the thought of that horrible
changed expression in his friend's
face — the expression of that evil woman's
eyes, and to the whispered words that had
seemed like a curse. “I'm out. You
passed me by. I shall not pass you
by!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to steady his mind, and possibly
to find a measure of relief in expression,
he sat down to put an analysis of
his mental state on paper. He worked
hard. But presently he paused and
looked about him. He heard the wind.
It had changed; and la bise was blowing
up over the Lake of Neuchatel. Now
and again it rose to a wild, whistling
cry that made him shiver. The clocks
of Colombier struck 1 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At length, in a calmer state of mind,
Dr Blane, half wondering, half laughing,
but still strangely nervous, put out the
candles and got into bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the moment the room was dark the
noise began again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no interval of guesswork; he
knew at once what it was. Something
was scratching at the door — outside. And
the curious part of it was that the instant
he heard it he realised that the door was
no sort of protection. That it was locked
was all a useless pretence. The thing
could, and would, get in to him. And
the next minute, with a nauseous rush
of terror, he knew that it was in. It
had somehow squeezed itself underneath
the door — and was pattering across the
bare boards to the side of his bed. And
as he heard it, that vile pattering seemed
inside him — on the very substance of his
heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual distance between door and
bed was small enough, but in those few
seconds of tense horror it stretched into
a hundred yards, and he knew all the
prolonged agony of steady, merciless approach
that a man fastened to the rails
must know when in the distance he hears
the first rumble of the coming train. For
a kind of paralysis crept over him so that
he could not move. His heart dropped
like lead. The perspiration that drenched
him froze instantly into ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the steps quickened for a running
leap: there was a sound of rushing
through the air; a gust of glacial
wind; and something dropped heavily
upon the bed by his feet — and then began
to climb quickly upwards towards his
face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Blane says he tried furiously to
shout, but could get no sound out above
a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensation of the footsteps treading
up the whole length of his paralysed body
was the most horrible thing he had ever
known. But his climax of terror brought
with it at least a certain power of movement,
and he was just able to bury his face
beneath a pile of clothes and pillows when
the thing settled down with a clinging
grip like wire netting upon his head,
and there began the most dreadful
struggle imaginable in the thick darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was an unequal fight. His
hands were so moist with the clamminess
of fear that the sheets slipped through
his fingers, and inch by inch the strength
of his adversary succeeded in uncovering
his face. First he felt it against the
skin of his neck, where thin fingers that
gripped like cold iron caught him behind
in a suddenly exposed place. The rest
went swiftly; for that touch of ice somehow
seemed to paralyse all the nerve
centres at a stroke and bereft him of any
power he had left. In a moment the
clothes were torn from off him, and he
lay there helpless and motionless on his
back, his face at last wholly uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, so close to his ear that the
breath touched him as though the bise
had forced a way in through the open
window, he heard a thin whisper of
words: “You passed me by. Now I'm
out. I shall not pass you by!” and immediately
after it came a smothering sensation
over eyes and mouth as though a
weight of snow had fallen to suffocate
him, while creeping through it a stinging
pain moved slowly down the sides of his
face towards the throat. It was like
claws of iron entering his flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freezing air of night blowing upon
his face revived him after what must have
been a long period of unconsciousness,
for the grey light of early morning was
in this room when he opened his eyes
again and there was a sound of movement
in the house below. With the precision
of a strong mind accustomed to quick reflection
and decision Dr Blane at once
realised the situation. There was no
groping of memory. It all came back
vividly, and in that very first minute of
returning consciousness he was aware
clearly of two things: first, that it had
all been real, and no dream; secondly,
that the terror had passed completely
from his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholly master of himself, yet with a
feeling that he was bruised and battered,
he got out of bed and examined the room.
And to his amazement he noticed for the
first time that the double windows were
wide open and the bise was blowing
straight into the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering greatly — for they had been
closed and fastened when he went to bed —
to shut them tight. Then he crossed the
floor to turn on the supply of hot air in
the radiator. It was on his way back
that he caught the reflection of his face in
the mirror that hung by the window.
The morning light fell full upon it. Down
both cheeks ran dull red lines that ended
in marks round the neck like the marks
of the rope he had known years before as
prison doctor on the neck of a hanged
man. There was no blood — merely a
dull contusion under the skin — and almost
as he looked the lines faded away and
were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But above them, signature of his great
terror was something else that did not
fade, and that remained to the day of his
death. A lock of hair over the right
temple had turned grey in a single night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_END --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- BODY_START --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Lady Rose was always sorry when her parents
left the country and came up to the big London house
for what they called the Season. She liked their own
woods and gardens much better than Hyde Park or Kensington
Gardens, where the formal flower-beds seemed less wonderful
than the primroses and anemones that blew wild at home.
She missed her friend Basseker as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker was Head Gardener. He had been in the family's
service long before she was born, and his knowledge of flowers
and shrubs, of everything that grew in the earth, was very
great indeed. It was &amp;quot;instinctive,&amp;quot; apparently, whatever that
might mean. &amp;quot;His instinct for the soil,&amp;quot; she once heard her
father say, &amp;quot;is really quite astonishing. I believe the fellow
was born underground among the roots!&amp;quot; He laughed as
he said it, but the idea of living underground made a deep
impression upon little Lady Rose's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker was a big, broad, powerful man, with a rumbling
booming voice that rose from his boots. A thick, brown,
bushy beard covered his mouth so that his lips might have
been anywhere. The tangle of hair ran like a jungle all over
his face. She thought of him as a great, delicious, earthy
being that made things grow. A smell of ripe apples, bast
and potting-sheds hung about him. She had an idea that
he was once clean-shaven, but had fallen asleep on Midsummer's
Night and waked next morning with this dense
growth all over his chin and cheeks. It had come out of the
rich black earth he loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a very gentle giant in spite of his alarming voice.
He shared all the mysteries of the garden with her. They
were very great friends. She longed to ask him if he really
lived underground, but could never quite screw her courage
up to the point. It seemed rather an impertinent question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're going to London next week, Basseker,&amp;quot; she now
informed him. &amp;quot;Mother wants the Season, you know.
You'll keep everything growing while we're away, won't
you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes, Missie,&amp;quot; rolled the deep voice — Basseker never
called her &amp;quot;your ladyship&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;and I'll be bringing up some
flowers for the big Parties sometimes, maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I shall see you, Basseker!&amp;quot; and she clapped her
hands. &amp;quot;That's lovely. I shall be in London all the Season,
I'm afraid, you see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great Head Gardener smiled, so that the jungle all
over his face moved like a cornfield in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope so, Missie,&amp;quot; he growled affectionately. And I
hope,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;to go and see my old mother. She lives
in London too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, where, Basseker?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Over Elephant and Castle way, Missie — if I can get
there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Lady Rose's eyes grew bigger. The name, which
she had never heard before, enchanted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does she live in a castle? And has she got an elephant?&amp;quot;
she asked breathlessly. &amp;quot;But how — &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt;, Basseker!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jungle waved about again as the big fellow smiled.
He hardly knew what to say at first, it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wonderful, Missie, indeed she is. She's ninety
four this coming June.&amp;quot; He hesitated a moment. If his
lordship'd allow it — I'd like to show her to you. The sight
of you, Missie, would do her a power o' good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose stared up into the great bushy face. Her mind was
working rapidly. Whether her father allowed it or not, she
decided to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It might make her grow, you mean?&amp;quot; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's no knowing Missie,&amp;quot; rumbled the invisible
mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how do you get there? Is it far?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazing down into the little upturned face, he told her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground, Missie — that's the way I generally go.&amp;quot;
The deep voice boomed, the tangled hair moved again in
rippling waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Oh!&amp;quot; cried Lady Rose, her eyes bigger than ever,
her excitement too great for a hundred questions she burned
to ask. And before she could find her voice again, Basseker
had moved away. &amp;quot;I must be getting along,&amp;quot; he explained,
&amp;quot;or my things'll forget to grow.&amp;quot; He placed a great earth-stained
finger against the jungle that hid his lips to enjoin
secrecy, and a moment later had disappeared among the
lilac trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Elephant &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Castle!&amp;quot; she repeated under her breath,
too thrilled to do more than whisper. &amp;quot;And he goes underground
to get there! Elephant … Castle … Underground …!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words ran singing in her mind for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a month later, June blazing in the sky, when from
an upper landing she caught sight of Basseker far below
among the passages of the great London mansion. He looked
the same as usual, except that he wore a white collar and rather
tidy clothes. Even before she saw him the scent of apples
and potting-sheds had reached her nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bed-time hour had come, but Lady Rose was too
excited to lie in bed waiting for her mother. She had crept
out in her red dressing-gown to have a peep. For there was
a big Dinner Party and Ball that night, and the house was
in commotion. Basseker, she realised, had brought up the
flowers for the decorations. He was frightfully busy, of course,
far too busy for her to get a word with him. Besides, he
could not even see her on that high upper landing. But
other people were busy too, far too busy to pay her attention
as usual. Parents, servants, nurses, all were in something
of a flutter, seeing to the last details of the great Entertainment
to which hundreds of people were coming. Rose, to her
keen joy, was neglected rather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother came rustling along the passage at length,
breathless, her eyes shining, and kissed her good-night as
usual, then tucked her up in bed and left the room, closing
the door softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Rosie, get to sleep quickly,&amp;quot; was her last remark,
&amp;quot;and I'll tell you all about it in the morning,&amp;quot; as the child
snuggled down among the sheets. She heard her mother's
silken skirts go swishing down the corridor, then die away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house grew still, the darkness covered her, the excitement
from the lower floors of the big house did not penetrate
to this upper region where the Night Nursery was. Little
Lady Rose closed her eyes, drew the blankets up to her cheek,
and prepared to fall asleep. Through the window, open at
the top, stole in the sweet night air of June. Her breathing
became slow, deep, regular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the sweet June air, it seemed, something else presently
came stealing in — a faint scent of ripe apples, of bast, of potting-sheds,
of earth. It was a delicate, delicious mixture,
very fragrant. Her dream shifted queerly towards Basseker,
the great Head Gardener. It began to play with him, the
giant figure that made things grow. She saw his bushy beard,
his kindly face, his slow, swaying walk; she heard his deep,
earthquakey voice. She realised adventure was about. Ideas
of a mighty elephant, a towering castle, shot past her. They
were underground somewhere. She was hunting for them,
hunting for the way. She could not find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sound like wind rustling in the branches of a tree was
wafted across the still darkness of the room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you ready, Missie?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes. She stared. She listened. Against
the window, where the faint light of the stars peeped in, she
saw the outline of broad shoulders and a great bushy head.
She recognised the massive bulk of Basseker. He was right
inside the room, not ten feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Basseker …!&amp;quot; she whispered, now wide awake, unable
to believe her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Time we were off, Missie,&amp;quot; came the deep whispered
answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose sprang out of bed. In a second she was in
her red dressing-gown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're going --?&amp;quot; she squeezed out in a breathless
whisper, too excited to manage more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With you,&amp;quot; rolled the boom of his quiet voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; she squeaked, feverishly thrusting a foot into the
sleeve of her dressing-gown in her amazement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's close on midnight,&amp;quot; he growled. Time to start!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it naughty, she asked herself? Was it being disobedient?
The temptation was irresistible. She was always
allowed to go with Basseker, she told herself. Always!
Anywhere! But, actually, she thought of only one thing --
how was she to manage it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I shall be seen, shan't I?&amp;quot; she asked tremblingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker moved up closer in the semi-darkness. It was
like a dim tree moving. &amp;quot;Get into this,&amp;quot; he said, and she
saw a big potato sack held wide open by his great brown
hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sack was clean and looked inviting. It smelt sweet.
She did not hesitate now. Scrambling feet first, she slipped
into its wide mouth, and the next minute felt herself swung
across the broad shoulders, dangling helplessly down his
back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the room and along the passages they went smoothly,
but down the back stairs was rather a bumpy business, and
Basseker had big bones in his shoulders that stuck into her
ribs. She lay curled up, head uppermost, of course, arms
tight against her sides, and she tried to look like a load of
potatoes as much as possible. The way Basseker strode along
gave her confidence. They passed the pantry and kitchen,
and the voices of the busy servants were audible. But no
one stopped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Going home, are you, Mr. Basseker?&amp;quot; she heard the
cook say with a yawn. &amp;quot;Off to see your mother, I suppose?
A big bundle you've got this time. Extra heavy it looks!
Something for the old lady, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Growing things,&amp;quot; replied Basseker, without stopping.
&amp;quot;They do weigh a bit, yes.&amp;quot; He strode on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose could feel the vibrations of his rumbling voice down
his spine. The cook called good-night, he answered her with
a grunt, and a moment later he had opened the service door
and was out in the street. She felt the cooler air, as he lowered
the big sack gently to the ground, peeped in to see if she were
all right, then hoisted her on to his shoulders again in a more
comfortable position. &amp;quot;We've got a bit yet to go,&amp;quot; he explained
gently, &amp;quot;and there are still a lot of people about.
I've made a hole for you to see through. Hold tight now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off they went again along the still busy pavements. Rose
could see the people streaming past, but they could not see
her. To them she seemed just a sack of potatoes. Policemen
eyed the bundle rather closely once or twice, but Basseker
looked too innocent for them to stop him and ask what he
had inside his sack; he looked just what he was — a Head
Gardener who had come up from the country. Meanwhile,
they had covered a mile or so, the streets were emptier, she
heard Big Ben strike the hour. She counted the strokes.
Basseker was counting them too.&amp;quot;One, two, three …
she could feel the sound rumbling down his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Twelve!&amp;quot; he said aloud, when the clock had finished,
&amp;quot;and here we are at last! Now,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;we go below.
You'll like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, Missie.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground?&amp;quot; she piped, bursting with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;But I mustn't let you out
till we get there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the hole in the sack Rose could see an enormous
gateway, a sort of high arched portal, brilliantly lit, with
people streaming through it into the street. They had white
faces, they looked tired, they were evidently hurrying home
to bed. The last one had passed them and the great hall
was empty, when Basseker's legs suddenly stopped moving
He no longer walked; his body kept quite still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Down we go,&amp;quot; he said in a thick whisper, &amp;quot;down, down,
down!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they began to sink. Sliding, sliding down into the
earth they went. It was a steady, easy motion, like sinking
into deep water. A low rumbling sound accompanied them,
but no voices, no footsteps. They were now alone. Rose
held her breath. She knew she was dropping through space,
and she began to wonder how much deeper they were going
to fall, when suddenly she heard Basseker's growling voice.
He was saying something to himself: &amp;quot;Step off with the right
foot,&amp;quot;  she heard. And the same instant she felt his leg move
forward with a jerk. They were on the level again. The
sinking was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Missie, I can let you out,&amp;quot; he said with a deep
sigh of relief, and opened the mouth of the sack. &amp;quot;And I
hope you haven't got the cramp or tied yourself into knots!&amp;quot;
He laughed, and the sound of his laughter went echoing away
into vast empty spaces beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose climbed out, straightened herself, rubbed her
eyes, and told him she was all right. She had not got cramp,
and she was not tied in a knot. She looked about her. She
understood at once why his voice had echoed, for she saw
great tunnels running in every direction. Their black gaping
mouths were all round her, and a queer, deep rumbling
murmur came out of them as from very far away. It rose
and fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that the elephants breathing?&amp;quot; she asked. She
wondered for a moment whether it was his old mother, but
she didn't like to say it. She was not a bit frightened. No
one could ever be frightened with Basseker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's just the echoes from the world above,&amp;quot; he explained
with a grin she thought wonderful. &amp;quot;But we're all
alone down here. It's after midnight, and there's no one
about. We've got a long way to go yet, and had better be
moving.&amp;quot; He took her by the hand and went up to a large iron
gateway above which was written in capital letters &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;No Exit.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She read this with an effort: &lt;em&gt;No Exit&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;That means we
mayn't go in, doesn't it?&amp;quot; she asked, still holding firmly to
his huge brown hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker studied it too, as though it were the label of one
of his rock-garden plants. &amp;quot;It means,&amp;quot; he replied at length,
&amp;quot;that most people mayn't go in, go out, rather, I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; say.
But &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; — he dropped her hand and made a wide gesture
with his arms — &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he went on proudly, &amp;quot;can go anywhere!
It's after midnight, and I'm going to see my mother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose stared up into his face. The hair, she thought, had
grown much longer. He was the bushiest thing she had
ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is she as old as &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot; she asked, for age, to her, meant
having peculiar privileges. &amp;quot;And does she ride on the elephant
into her very own castle?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basseker made no direct reply to this. His beard rippled
with his laughter. How white his collar was! How his
voice boomed and echoed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All this Underground,&amp;quot; he remarked, &amp;quot;belongs to us --
till four o'clock in the morning. We can go where we like.
There's not a living soul to stop us. We're underneath the
whole of London town. Come on, let's get a-going!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grabbed her hand again. He whistled. The great
iron gate flew open. They shot through like a couple of
projectiles from the muzzle of some enormous gun. And
Rose found herself standing at the entrance to an immense
tunnel that gaped into black space before her. At her feet
she saw two gleaming metal rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There we are, Missie!&amp;quot; cried Basseker. &amp;quot;And this is
how we go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stooped down and did something to his boots, and then
placed one foot on each shining rail. The next minute he
was doing the same thing to her own feet, whatever it was.
He straightened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, Missie, can you keep your balance? We go
pretty fast, remember.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He straddled like a giraffe when it lowers itself to drink.
Her own feet were placed like his own, one on each rail, so
that she, too, straddled, wide enough for someone to have
shot between her legs. She drew a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I shan't split, shall I?&amp;quot; she cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No fear, Missie, but you'll go like greased lightning.
Now, take my hand. It's a long way to the Elephant and
Castle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She just had time to snatch his hand when they were off.
Her feet, one glued to each rail, began to move. Basseker
shot forward, sliding as if he were on skates. She followed
him, half dragged, half gliding by her own weight. It seemed
like going downhill. They fairly flew. But her feet kept
easily to the rails, which were as smooth as ice or butter.
The dark walls of the tunnel flashed past her, the air rushed
into her face, she was aware of Basseker's beard streaming
past her like a river. Her eyes began to water, she couldn't
get her breath, her red dressing gown flew out on both sides
like a flag in the wind. They raced along like lightning
But she never felt her balance waver. She kept steady,
leaning a little forward in her effort to keep hold of Basseker's
hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! Whirr!&amp;quot; she screamed with delight. &amp;quot;I'm
flying, flying!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quicker than growing, ain't it, Missie,&amp;quot; shouted Basseker,
and his voice seemed to drop a mile behind him into space
before the words were properly out. If flowers grew as fast
as this, she thought, they would be up in a night. Yet sometimes
they did come up in a single night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this where all the roots are?&amp;quot; she tried to ask. &amp;quot;Are
we underground where the flowers begin to grow? Is your
mother growing underground? And where's the Elephant?
Where's the Castle?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the wind caught her tiny voice and whipped it into
space behind them before he could catch a single syllable.
Her hair was plastered across her mouth, and when she tried
to brush it away the sleeve of her dressing-gown was almost
torn from its seams. Her hand and arm, she even thought,
would be swept away with it. They flew along at a terrific
speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, the darkness lifted, and she saw a round
circle of bright light ahead. It seemed miles away. It grew
larger and larger. It was white and silvery. They were
rushing towards it. Every second it became bigger. And
she knew what it was. It was the mouth of the tunnel. They
were coming out of the black darkness into the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second later they were out, and the brilliance was so
dazzling that at first Rose could only shade her eyes and
blink. &amp;quot;Well done, Missie,&amp;quot; she heard Basseker's booming
voice. &amp;quot;You're a first-rate Slider. You're as good under
ground as I am, and I've been at it for years!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we?&amp;quot; she asked, recovering her breath while
he stooped to lift her feet from the slippery rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Underground,&amp;quot; he replied, &amp;quot;and in the Castle gardens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then where does the light come from? Why isn't it
dark?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed and stood up straight. &amp;quot;Because the sunshine
that falls on the ground all day sinks through,&amp;quot;  he explained.
&amp;quot;It isn't lost. It slips down here between the earth
and rocks and gets into the growing things before they show
up above us in the air.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And your mother, Basseker? And the Castle? And
the Elephant?&amp;quot; she asked, still panting from the recent headlong
rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just look!&amp;quot; he told her. &amp;quot;Open your eyes, Missie, and
look!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did so, for she was now accustomed to the light,
which no longer dazzled her. All about her, as far as the eye
could reach, lay a stretch of park-like garden, basking in warm
sunshine, and covered with flowers in their wild state, from
snowdrops and violets to anemones, sweet williams, daffodils,
lilies and crocuses. There were thousands of them, spring,
summer and autumn flowers, all growing at once. Fruit
trees filled the air with blossom, lilac and laburnum hung in
falling waves, honeysuckle and wild roses starred the landscape
everywhere. And through these, rising into the still,
bright air, stood up in the distance the turrets and spires of
a magnificent castle, its grey walls gleaming, its roofs and
windows gleaming like silver against the sky. From a pole
at the very top a coloured flag streamed gaily in the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose caught her breath. &amp;quot;Oh Basseker!&amp;quot; she
cried, &amp;quot;what a lovely, lovely place!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course it is,&amp;quot; he growled. &amp;quot;You wouldn't expect
flowers to come from a place that wasn't lovely! Would
you now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before she could answer a curious deep sound broke
in upon the silence. Thud — thud — thud, it came. It was
followed by a trumpeting noise she had never heard before.
Nearer and nearer came the thuds; the ground seemed to
tremble; something was thumping down towards them through
the orchard, and when she turned to look she saw a gigantic
shape that was higher than the trees moving slowly in their
direction. It was quite close already, not fifty yards away
It was coming straight at her, it seemed, and she ran up to
Basseker and hid her face in his coat. It was an elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There, there, Missie,&amp;quot; he laughed in his deepest
tones, so that she could feel the sound vibrating against his
waistcoat, &amp;quot;there's nothing to be afraid of. It's only Beauty
coming to take us up to the Castle where my mother lives!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She peeped. The monster had come to a stop beside
them and was flapping his huge ears. His eyes looked down
at her. The same minute he lowered his enormous bulk
towards the ground, his trunk swept out till its end almost
touched her hand as though it waited for a bun, and the tiny
tail at the other end of the immense body began to tweak
this way and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He likes you, Missie. He's offering you a seat on his
back. He'll carry us both. Just put your foot in his trunk
and he'll lift you up as easy as rolling into bed!&amp;quot; He laughed
and pointed and Rose saw that the end of the trunk was
curved like the letter U. Her fear had suddenly left her, for
she felt that the great beast was as kind and gentle as he was
big. Slowly lifting her foot, she placed it in the curve of the
trunk, grabbed at the rough, thick skin with both hands, and
the next instant was hoisted through the air and set down
on the broad back as delicately as a leaf falls to the ground
in autumn. A moment later Basseker was similarly raised
and dropped close behind her so that he could hold her with
both his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this in itself was exciting enough to take all the
attention she had, but there was something else she had
noticed that excited her almost more — and that was that her
foot as she had placed it in the curved trunk, no longer
wore the bedroom slipper she had left the house with, but
was now of shining yellow. It was a golden slipper. On
the left foot was another golden slipper exactly like it, and
her red dressing-gown had completely changed as well. It
was now a golden dress, shining with the gold of laburnum,
buttercups and dandelions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Basseker!&amp;quot; she cried. &amp;quot;I've changed to gold! I'm
dressed in gold! When did it happen?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I'm in silver,&amp;quot; he replied with a deep chuckle.
&amp;quot;It happened in the tunnel. The speed did that. We've
got to be lovely too, everything's got to be lovely here.&amp;quot; And
she now realized for the first time that he wore silver from
head to foot and a silver plume waved on his head, so that
he looked like a knight in a fairy tale rather than a Head
Gardener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hoop-la, Beauty! Off we go!&amp;quot; he boomed, and the
elephant began to move ponderously up the slope between
the crowding fruit trees. It swayed from side to side, but
it went carefully forward, as though remembering that it
carried a precious load. There was never any danger of the
riders slipping off. And its huge feet, Rose noticed, avoided
stepping on the flowers, as it picked its way as delicately as
a skater doing tricks between standing bottles that must not
be knocked over. Below her spread the tops of the fruit
trees with their sea of blossoms. Yet some of these trees,
to her surprise, bore fruit instead of blossoms. Everything
seemed to grow at once in this marvellous great garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; she cried, &amp;quot;there's a lovely pear, all ripe and
juicy! How I should like to eat it!&amp;quot; And, hardly had the
words left her lips, when the long flexible trunk had plucked
the fruit from the bough and, curling backwards over the
broad flat head, was offering it to her. She took it, a little
cautiously, exclaimed &amp;quot;Oh, thank you, Beauty!&amp;quot; and handed
it to Basseker. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; have it, please,&amp;quot; she said, holding it
out to him over her shoulder. But the elephant was quicker
than she was; already the trunk had picked another for
Basseker too, and was poking it into his mouth. Grapes,
oranges, cherries, and even strawberries were fed to them in
this way as the monster slowly climbed the slope towards
the Castle, but when Rose saw some lilies and asked if she
might have these too, the huge beast did not move his trunk
to pick them. Instead, the giant head wagged slowly to and
fro and from side to side, though too gently to upset the
balance of his riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He's shaking his head!&amp;quot; cried Rose. &amp;quot;Does that mean
I can't have the lilies?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He never picks flowers,&amp;quot; explained Basseker. &amp;quot;He
won't touch growing things, Missie. Why, he doesn't even
step on them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, they emerged from the orchard and the
trees were behind them. A bright green lawn, smooth as
a billiard table and creamy with a million white daisies
stretched in front, with a gravel path that looked like brown
sugar winding up to the castle walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great Castle now faced them, the biggest she had
ever seen; there seemed countless windows, and that meant
countless rooms behind them. The light grey stone of which
it was built gave it a silvery appearance. It was far, far too
big for one person to occupy; Rose decided that no one person
could possibly need so many rooms. Basseker's old mother
could hardly use them all. Her mind became so full of
questions that she could not frame a single one at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quite right, Missie,&amp;quot; growled the deep voice against her
neck, for he evidently had read her thoughts,&amp;quot; there's only
one living-room. The others are kept — oh, for all sorts of
things. You'll see presently for yourself. But first you must
be introduced to my mother. She's expecting you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we get in? There's no door. Not a single
door anywhere!&amp;quot; Rose gasped. She had been searching for
a door, but could not find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right again, Missie,&amp;quot; said Basseker with a grin. All
in good time. Now, Beauty,&amp;quot; he addressed the elephant,
&amp;quot;just stand still a minute, then ring the bell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monster stopped; he was close against the walls;
and the same instant he raised his trunk in the air and let out
a trumpeting that might have been heard a mile away. Three
times he trumpeted, then turned his little eyes upwards in
the direction of the second storey. Basseker glanced up too,
and Rose did the same. A moment passed, but only a moment,
for almost immediately a window on the second floor was
flung wide open, and the face and figure of a little old woman
was seen looking out and down at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here we are,&amp;quot; boomed Basseker. &amp;quot;We've both come,
you see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The face broke into smiles, and two hands were stretched
out far above them over the window-ledge. &amp;quot;Welcome to
your little ladyship,&amp;quot; exclaimed a gentle voice, &amp;quot;and will you
please come inside and see me?&amp;quot; She waved her hands she
beckoned. &amp;quot;I've such a lot to show you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I'd like to,&amp;quot; called Rose, &amp;quot;but how can I get up
to you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's quite easy,&amp;quot; replied the gentle voice, and before
anyone could say another word, the elephant had twined his
long trunk about her waist and lifted her high in the air
towards the window. A second later she was across the ledge
and safely in the old woman's arms, and the smiling old face
which, Rose thought, was like a ripe, wrinkled apple in the
sun, had kissed her. Dressed in purple silk, her bright eyes
sparkling, a white sun-bonnet about the head, smelling like
a lily too, Rose thought of her as a wild iris growing on some
river bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh!&amp;quot; she exclaimed, as she returned the kiss, &amp;quot;I believe
you really are a flower! And thank you for inviting me.
And are you really going to show me all sorts of things? And
do you live alone in the Castle? And — and&amp;quot; — she looked
about her — &amp;quot;where's &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; — your son, I mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a gleam of something silvery flashing through
the open window, a thud on the floor, and Basseker, lifted by
the trunk, stood beside them. The little old woman in purple,
Basseker in silver, and Rose in gold — it was a picture straight
out of fairyland. And when Basseker lifted his mother in
his arms and kissed her, Rose thought of some Knight in her
storybooks at home rescuing an imprisoned Princess from
the Ogre's tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything growing nicely, is it?&amp;quot; Basseker asked, and
the old woman, smiling down at Rose, said: &amp;quot;Yes, everything,
including &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; as she stroked the child's hair. &amp;quot;Just
like her name, too, isn't she?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; growled her son, &amp;quot;and she loves a garden
as much as we do; that's why I brought her. Now, there
isn't too much time, mother. We must get back before dawn,
remember. You'd better show her about at once. There's
lots to see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started off through the great Castle, going from
room to room, down endless corridors, along winding galleries,
up and down staircases, and through enormous halls. &amp;quot;We
get everything ready here, you see,&amp;quot;  explained the old woman,
&amp;quot;for sending up above, where you see them coming out of
the earth as flowers and shrubs and trees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one great room lay thousands of bulbs of various sorts,
in another the floor was several feet deep in seeds, a third
was full of cuttings, buds, and little sprays for grafting. One
very large hall held nothing but fruit, another roots and
vegetables, a third sweet-smelling herbs, a fourth flowering
trees and shrubs such as lilac, laburnum, lavender and sweet-briar.
Some rooms were cool and others hot, according to
what they contained, and the galleries were laid down with
different kinds of earth and soil, a foot deep, while the lower
floors were given over to mosses, ferns, and the kind of growing
things that needed damp, spongy ground. Across the ground
floor, running the whole length of the Castle, was a little
tinkling stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The bees and the birds, mother,&amp;quot; came Basseker's deep
voice. &amp;quot;Don't forget to show her those. Time's getting on,
too. We mustn't linger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They climbed a long, winding staircase that went up into
one of the lofty towers, on each landing of which there was
one very large room, and as they neared the first a deep murmuring
sound was audible inside. The door had a sheet of
glass let into it like a window. Basseker put his face against
it and looked through, but did not open the door. The murmuring
rose and fell like the sound of surf a long way off.
Rose hesitated, as he drew back to let her see, for the curious
noise rather frightened her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing to hurt you, Missie,&amp;quot; he told her. &amp;quot;They
won't touch you, because they can't. Just have a peep
through the glass.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She put her face against the pane and stared and it was
indeed a queer sight she saw. The air was alive with movement --
thousands of little objects circled through it in all
directions, in streams and lines and clusters. They were
flying things, but at first she could not guess what they were.
The windows were wide open, the room was full of sunlight,
and flowers of all sorts, she saw, grew on the floor, hung from
the ceiling, and even clung to the walls. The little flying
objects circled about everywhere but especially near the
flowers, and while hundreds kept going through the window
into the open air, hundreds more flew in to take their places,
Rose started and stared, wondering what it all meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bees, Missie,&amp;quot; Basseker's deep voice explained behind
her. &amp;quot;They're practising collecting pollen while they suck
the honey, so that they can spread it from flower to flower
when they get above ground again. There are millions of
them in that big room!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next landing, close under the very roof of the
tower, were the birds, and Rose found it even more wonderful
than the bee room. For here she saw the birds — thrushes,
blackbirds, swallows, finches, tits — learning which flies and
grubs and insects injured the growing plants, and which,
therefore, they must eat so that the plants could have a chance
to grow. She was so fascinated that old Mrs. Basseker had
to drag her away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as they wandered from room to room, the
time was passing, and presently a loud trumpeting from the
elephant outside warned them that they must hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oho!&amp;quot; cried Basseker, &amp;quot;that means the dawn is coming
We must be getting back, mother. The Underground is only
empty till four o'clock, remember. Beauty's giving us a hint!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But we haven't had tea yet,&amp;quot; complained the old woman,
&amp;quot;and there's strawberry jam and meringues and gooseberry-fool
and trifle and a dozen other things her ladyship likes.
Besides, there are the water-plants to show her still, the magic
sunflowers, the lotus buds, and — oh, a hundred more. And
the weeds — we haven't shown her how we kill the awful
weeds — &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another time, mother; another time!&amp;quot; cried Basseker.
&amp;quot;She mustn't be late. After four o'clock the Tubes are full
of trains and people. Besides, I've got to get her up to her
room again safely. And then I must get back to the home
gardens myself!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant kept on trumpeting, and Basseker and his
mother kept on talking both at once. But the time had come;
they had to go. They could not risk being caught by the
trains and the people in the network of tunnels and tubes
beneath old London town. Basseker knew his business.
That's why he was such a marvellous Head Gardener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Father told me you were born underground,&amp;quot;  piped
Rose breathlessly, as he took her by the hand and pulled her
downstairs, across the halls and galleries to the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodbye, your ladyship, and please come again!&amp;quot; cried
the old mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trunk poked its end through the window into the
room. It went curving and wriggling about, searching for
its human luggage. It found Rose's little waist and fastened
itself round it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodbye, Mrs. Basseker, goodbye!&amp;quot; she cried as she
was caught and whisked through the window. She landed
gently on the broad back. Next, Basseker followed her
through the air and sat behind her. The old woman smiled
and waved her purple arms. They started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're a bit late, Beauty,&amp;quot; Basseker said, and the monster
understood and went swiftly down the gravel path and through
the fruit trees till they reached the tunnel mouth. &amp;quot;We're
very late,&amp;quot; boomed Basseker. &amp;quot;I doubt if we shall do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For answer the elephant, having reached the opening,
stooped, placed his enormous feet carefully on the rails, and
suddenly — shot inside with both riders still upon his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well done, Beauty!&amp;quot; cried Basseker. You're a wonderful
fellow!&amp;quot; He turned Rose's face towards him and added:
&amp;quot;He goes twice as fast as we can!&amp;quot; They were off. &amp;quot;Hold
tight!&amp;quot; he bawled. &amp;quot;I've got you! Keep your face down!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shot away like lightning. The wind roared past
them. The elephant's body almost filled the tunnel, but he
never wavered, his great feet held safely to the slippery rails.
Occasionally his long trunk came backwards over his shoulders
to feel if his riders were safe. The monster shot like a meteor
racing through the sky. It was a marvellous performance.
Then, gradually, his speed slackened; a round hole of light
appeared beyond his flapping ears; the end of the tunnel was
in sight. They reached the station. Already the electric
lights were turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We've just time!&amp;quot; called Basseker breathlessly, as the
trunk lifted them both down in turn. &amp;quot;Goodbye, Beauty!
And we can't thank you enough. Without your help we
should never have got here in time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant turned round with his head pointing into the
tunnel again; he flapped his ears, his small eyes peeped at
the two passengers, his trunk came wriggling round and touched
Rose's hand to say goodbye, and the next second — he was
off. His huge bulk, looking like a great haystack, slid into
the big black mouth of the Tube, and he shot away like an
arrow. He was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose waved her hand and cried &amp;quot;Goodbye, goodbye!&amp;quot;
when Basseker interrupted her. He no longer wore silvery
clothes, her own red dressing-gown had come back too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not a minute to spare,&amp;quot; he whispered. &amp;quot;I hear voices.
The ticket-collectors and conductors are coming back to
work already. The trains will start any minute now. Hop
in, Missie, hop in!&amp;quot; He held the sack open for her; she
stepped inside; the next instant she was swung across his
back again and he had begun to take his long, steady strides
across the platforms. She curled up as best she could, closed
her eyes, and tried to think of all the wonderful things she
had seen and heard. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it was a queer fact, but natural, perhaps, that she
felt drowsy suddenly. The swing of Basseker's long stride
was soothing. He moved easily and gently. She remembered
when the gliding began -- uphill this time, instead of down --
but, oddly enough, she did not notice when it stopped.
&amp;quot;Right foot … step off with the right …&amp;quot; she heard his
deep rumble as he spoke to himself, but the actual instant
when he left the sliding staircase and crossed the level platform
into the street made no impression on her. Once or
twice she heard him say &amp;quot;Good-morning! Fine day again!&amp;quot;
evidently to someone, a policeman, perhaps, whom he passed
in the still empty streets, but beyond that she remembered
nothing until she was aware that he was climbing slowly and
stealthily up a long series of steps. She knew then that they
were in the house again. Suddenly he stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Here we are, Missie,&amp;quot; he whispered. She heard a
handle rattle. He was opening a door. She felt him walk
in. She heard the door closed behind them. Then she felt
him carefully lowering the heavy sack from his shoulders.
The cool air touched her face. It was light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She opened her eyes in her own bedroom, where the dawn
was creeping in through the open window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One, two, three!&amp;quot; whispered Basseker, and with a
gentle heave he dumped her out of the mouth of the sack and
into her own bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood there a minute looking down at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh please take me again some day, Basseker,&amp;quot; she
whispered breathlessly, &amp;quot;please, please. I loved it so.…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He whispered back, as he pulled the bedclothes up to her
chin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another time, Missie, I will. There's lots more to see
besides the Elephant and Castle — there's the Black Friars, the
Cross King, the Swiss Cottage, the Court of the Baron and
the Raven, the Seven Sisters with their Seven Dials, the old
Parson of the Green, the Three Circuses … and … and
now I must be off to catch my train to the country and see
how my things — &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; things — are growing.…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was gone. The house was very still. The servants
all lay asleep. The dawn grew brighter. Lady Rose closed
her eyes and promptly fell sound asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If seeing is believing the story, of course, is justified, and stands
foursquare as a fact, for certainly both my cousin and myself saw
the thing as clearly as we saw the village church and the wooded
mountains beyond, which were its background. There may, how-
ever, be other explanations, and my cousin, who is something of
a psychologist, availed himself volubly of the occasion to ride his
pet hobby. He easily riddled the saying that seeing is believing,
while I listened as patiently as possible. Although no psychologist
myself, I knew that the phrase was as inadequate as most other
generalisations. Indeed, there is no commoner act of magic in
daily life than that of sight, by which the mind projects into the
air an image, translated objectively from a sensation in the brain
caused by light irritating the optic nerve. &amp;quot;The picture on the
retina, upside down, anyhow,&amp;quot; he kept telling me afterwards, &amp;quot;is
not the object itself that throws off the light-rays, is it? You never
see the actual object, do you? You're merely playing with an
image, eh? It's pure image-ination, don't you see? It's simple
magic, the magic that everybody denies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, somehow, nothing he could offer by way of explanation
satisfied me. The question form of his sentences, moreover, irritated.
I rather clung to &amp;quot;seeing is believing,&amp;quot; and I think in his
heart he did the same, for all his cloud of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was evening, and the summer dusk was falling, as we
tramped in silence up the hill towards the village where my cousin,
with his wife and children, occupy the upper part of an old chalet.
We had been climbing Jura cliffs all day; it had been arduous,
exciting work, and we both were tired out. Conversation had long
since ceased; our legs moved mechanically, and we both devoutly
wished we were at home. &amp;quot;Ah, there's the cemetery at last,&amp;quot; he
sighed, as the landmark near the village came into view. &amp;quot;Thank
goodness!&amp;quot; and I was too weary even to make the obvious commentary.
The relief of lying down seemed in his mind. With a
grunt by way of reply I glanced carelessly at the rough stone-wall
surrounding the ugly patch cut squarely from the vineyards, and at
the formal pines and larches that stood, plume-like, among the
pleasant graves. &amp;quot;Old mère Corbillard is safe and snug in her
last resting-place,&amp;quot; he added, as we passed the painted iron-gate,
&amp;quot;and a good thing too!&amp;quot; There was relief in his tone, but a
moment later there was vivid annoyance. &amp;quot;Izzie,&amp;quot; he cried,
stopping short, &amp;quot;what are you doing again in there? You know
your mother forbade you to go any more. What a naughty, disobedient
child you are!&amp;quot; And he called to his fourteen-year-old
child to come out. She came at once, but listlessly, and not one
whit afraid. He scolded her a little. &amp;quot;I was only putting flowers
on the grave,&amp;quot; she said. Her face wore a puzzled, scared expression,
and the eyes were very bright — she had wonderful brown
eyes — but it was not her father's chiding that caused the look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took our arms with affectionate possession, as her way was,
and we all three laboured up the hill together. No more was said: her
father was too tired to find further fault. &amp;quot;Please don't tell
mother, Daddy, will you?&amp;quot; she whispered, as we reached the chalet
and went in; &amp;quot;I promise faithfully not to go again.&amp;quot; He said
nothing, but I saw him give her a kiss, and I gave her one myself.
The feeling was strong in me that she was frightened and needed
protection. I put my arm tightly round her, giving her a good
warm hug. The pleading, helpless look she gave me in return
I shall not soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory of &amp;quot;old mère Corbillard&amp;quot; no one cared to keep
alive — the wealthy peasant who had died a week ago. Known as
&amp;quot;la mauvaise riche,&amp;quot; because of her miserly habits, she was also
credited with stealing her neighbours' cats for the purpose of devouring
them — &amp;quot;lapin de montagne,&amp;quot; as the natives termed the
horrid dish. Her face was sinister — steel-grey eyes, hooked nose,
and prominent teeth — and had the village soul been more imaginative
or superstitious, she would certainly have been called a witch.
As it was, she merely passed for &amp;quot;méchante&amp;quot; and distinctly
&amp;quot;toquée.&amp;quot; Held in general disfavour, she was avoided and disliked,
and she repaid the hatred well, thanks to her money. She
lived in utter solitude, the one companion, oddly enough, to whom
admittance was never denied, being — Izzie. &amp;quot;Oddly enough,&amp;quot; because,
while the old woman was half-imbecile, maliciously imbecile,
the child, on her side — to put it kindly — was unusually backward
for her age, if not mentally deficient. But Izzie's deficiency
was of mild and gentle quality — a sweet child, if ever there was
one. And the parents, while barely tolerating the strange acquaintanceship,
never knew how frequent the visits were. They always
meant to stop the friendship, yet had never done so. Izzie, true
solitary, kept to herself too much. She loved the old woman's
stories. They hesitated to say the final No. Thus, at first, they
let her go to put fresh flowers, which she picked herself, upon the
grave, until, feeling that her too constant journeys there were
morbid, the ultimatum had gone forth that they must stop. &amp;quot;It's
queer that you should care to go so often,&amp;quot; said her father. &amp;quot;It's
not right,&amp;quot; added her mother, the parents exchanging a look that
meant they scented some unholy influence at work. &amp;quot;But I promised
to do it every day,&amp;quot; said Izzie frankly. Then further explanations
elicited the unwelcome addition: &amp;quot;She said she would
come and fetch me if I didn't&amp;quot; — and the influence of the old
woman seemed defined. &amp;quot;Ha, ha!&amp;quot; said mother's eyes to father;
&amp;quot;so the old wretch frightened her apparently into the promise,&amp;quot;
and they congratulated themselves that the mischief had been
stopped in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident was slight enough. The imagination of the backward
child, perhaps a little morbidly inclined owing to her love of
solitude, had been unduly stimulated. It had been gently, wisely
corrected, and the matter was at an end. Yet, somehow, for me,
it lingered in my memory, as though something very vital lay at
the core of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There followed forty-eight hours of soaking rain that kept us
all indoors, and after it a day of cloudless sunshine that made
everybody happy. We romped and played with the children, basked
in the delicious heat, and were generally full of active mischief.
Mother, mending stockings and trying to write letters, had a merry
time of it. But joy and forgiveness ruled the day, and one was
ashamed to feel vexation at anything with such a sun in the
heavens. Only Izzie, I noticed, kept apart; she was listless and indifferent,
joining in no games; her thin, pale face, in contrast to the
strange brilliance of her eyes, was evidence to me of some force
busily at work within. But she kept it fairly well concealed; it
seemed natural for her to moon about alone; I think no one else
noticed that her behaviour was more marked than usual. With the
cunning of the slow-witted she avoided me in particular, guessing
that I was ready to make advances. She divined that I understood.
Hiding my purpose as well as possible, I kept her closely under
observation, and after supper, when she strolled off alone down the
road between the vineyards, I called to Daddy to come and have a
pipe. We followed her. The moment we caught her up she turned
and took her place as usual, an arm to each. How tall she seemed;
she almost topped her father. She kept silence, merely walking in
step with us, and holding us rather close I thought, as though glad
of our presence though she had started off alone. At first
Daddy made efforts to draw her into conversation — efforts that
failed utterly. For my part, I let her be, content to keep her arm
firmly in my own, for there was very strong in me the feeling that I
must protect and watch, guarding her from something that she
feared yet was unable to resist. We talked across her, I guiding
the conversation towards fun, and she was so tall that we had to
stoop and lean forward to see each other's faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot sun had dried the road up, and the evening was still and
peaceful. We paced slowly to and fro, turning always at the village
fountain, and again at the crest of the hill where the descent
went steeply towards the cemetery. And here, at each turning
Izzie lingered a moment and looked down the hill. I felt perceptibly
the dragging on my arm. Once, at the fountain, I made to follow
the road through the village. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; said the child, with decision
I disliked intensely. &amp;quot;let's go back again,&amp;quot; and we obeyed meekly.
&amp;quot;Little tyrant,&amp;quot; said her unobservant father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountains rose in a wall of purple shadow, their ridges
outlined against a fading sky of gold and crimson. Thin columns
of peat smoke traced their scaffolding across it faintly, then melted
out. From time to time a group of labourers from the vineyards
passed us, singing the Dalcroze songs, taking their hats off, and
saying &amp;quot;Bon soir, bonne nuit.&amp;quot; We knew them all. Izzie
watched them go — with almost feverish interest. I got the queer
impression she was waiting till the last group had gone home. She
certainly was waiting for something; there was a covert expectancy
in her manner that stirred my former uneasiness. And this uneasiness
grew stronger every minute. I could hardly listen to my
cousin's desultory talk. At last I brought things suddenly to a
head, for it was more than my nerves could stand. Abruptly I
stood still. The other two, linked arm-in-arm stood with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daddy,&amp;quot; I said sharply, &amp;quot;let's go in,&amp;quot; and was going to add
peremptorily, &amp;quot;Take Izzie with you,&amp;quot; when the words died away on
my lips and the tongue in my mouth went dry. My blood seemed
turned to ice. For a second I stood in rigid paralysis. For the
figure between us, she whose arms were linked to ours, was not
Izzie, but another. A gaunt, lean face peered close into my own
through the dusk as I stooped to see my cousin, and the eyes were
of cold steel grey instead of brown. The skin was lined and furrowed,
and projecting teeth of an aged woman gleamed faintly
below the great hooked nose. It was mère Corbillard who stood
between us, hanging her withered hands upon our arms, her sinister
face so close that her straggling thin grey hair even touched our
shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dreadful sight was as vividly defined as the white face of
my cousin which I saw the same instant just beyond: and by his
ghastly pallor, and the water in his eyes, I knew that he had seen
her too. His lips were parted, his right hand was raised and
clenched. I thought he was going to strike, but instead, wrenching
himself violently free, he sprang to one side with an expression of
horror that was more a cry than actual words. There was a shriek;
whose I dare not say; it may have been my own for all my scattered
senses can remember. To this day what I recall was the sensation
of death upon my arm, and the glare of those steely eyes that peered
triumphantly into my own — then a momentary darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All happened in less than a second. The figure had broken loose
from between us, and was racing down the road like a flying
shadow — towards the cemetery. Yet the figure we watched an
instant before starting in frantic pursuit was unmistakably — Izzie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my cousin belongs the reward of prompt action and recapture.
We simply flew. And he caught the child long before
she reached the forbidden gates. Weeping, white and frightened,
we half carried her indoors, and explained to her alarmed mother
that she had been taken suddenly ill, &lt;em&gt;crise de nerfs&lt;/em&gt;, as Daddy,
with presence of mind, described it. It was not the first time; Izzie
had been too often hysterical to cause undue anxiety. Mother will
never know the truth unless she reads this story, which is unlikely,
since her mending and darning leave her little leisure for newspapers.
My cousin and myself have discussed the thing &lt;em&gt;ad
nauseam&lt;/em&gt;, and, as I have indicated, he explained it in a variety of
ways. But neither of us know what Izzie thought or felt. We,
of course, dared not ask her, and the child has never volunteered a
word. That she was severely frightened only is clear. She never
passes the cemetery alone now, and the name of old mère Corbillard
has not passed her lips a single time. My cousin's discovery of
the horror, however, coincided with my own. Comparing notes
proved that. He had been aware of no uneasy sensations previously
as I had been. Telepathy, therefore, was the clue he
finally decided on. &amp;quot;It covers more ground than that word 'possession'
and has besides,&amp;quot; as he said &amp;quot;a sort of scientific sound.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Pelham
reached
the doctor's
house on the
stroke of half-past
eleven, and as he
pushed the Night Bell
button he felt pleased
with his punctuality.
He had kept the
appointment to the
minute. He looked
like a traveller just off the train, yet not
quite suitably dressed for a warm night
in summer. A hint of adventure might
have betrayed itself to a discerning eye.
In addition to a heavy overcoat, he
carried a plaid rug, and a walker's knapsack
was slung across one shoulder, while
a stout stick and a felt hat completed
the outfit. His mind ran over the contents
of the knapsack for the twentieth time —
candles, thermos of coffee, sandwiches, book,
pistol; and the keys were in his pocket. He
had forgotten nothing. His bright eyes
betrayed a certain tension;
he was excited;
the occasional shiver
that ran down his
spine this warm June
night, he assured himself,
was anticipation
merely. Perhaps it
was. He remembered
telling his friend, Dr.
Feldman, that he
intended to go in any
case. &amp;quot;I shall sit up till dawn,&amp;quot; he said.
&amp;quot;If you won't come, I shall go alone.&amp;quot; He
had meant it, too, only that was in the daytime,
and now, with the darkness, his mood
had shifted. Companionship, he realized
would be most desirable. The presence of
burly Dr. Feldman, with his black beard,
his deep voice, his big shoulders, and his
clear brown eyes, would be undeniably
welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave the bell another push, pressing it
hard, for the minutes had slipped by. &amp;quot;I'm
on the tick,&amp;quot; he repeated, looking at his
watch again. &amp;quot;He said he would be ready
at eleven-thirty sharp, barring an urgent call.
Ah!&amp;quot; he reflected, with sudden uneasiness,
&amp;quot;I'd rather forgotten that!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voice close behind him made him start,
and turning sharply he saw the door wide
open and the parlour-maid upon the step.
She had been speaking, he realized, for a
moment or two, but at first he hardly took
in what she was saying. Then his heart
sank. &amp;quot;Gone out!&amp;quot; he stammered, in
obvious dismay. &amp;quot;But the doctor expected
me! We had an appointment!&amp;quot; He was
rather flustered. &amp;quot;It's just eleven-thirty, the
time he said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There was an important call,
sir. Dr. Feldman left this for
you.&amp;quot; He read the note hurriedly
on the mat. &amp;quot;I'm
called out,&amp;quot; it ran. &amp;quot;Urgent
case. I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; go. It shouldn't
take long, and I'll join you in
the house the moment I'm
free. Leave key under the
door. M. F., 11 p.m.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The doctor told me to
say, sir, that he should
meet you &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; he heard
the girl's voice through
his shock of disappointment;
&amp;quot;and
that he would
bring his own
things with
him for the
night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man's composure was upset.
&amp;quot;Yes, I see,&amp;quot; he mumbled, stupidly; &amp;quot;we
had arranged to walk instead of taking a
taxi, so as not to attract attention — &amp;quot;
He paused, realizing that the girl would not
know what he was talking about. &amp;quot;Will
you come in, sir, and wait?&amp;quot; she asked,
noticing his hesitation. No, he wouldn't do
that. He thanked her. &amp;quot;It's all right,&amp;quot; he
said, as casually as he could, then turned —
it cost him a certain effort — and walked
slowly down the deserted street alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot; he noticed; the disinclination
to leave companionship and light.
The shock of disappointment rather surprised
him too: its strength, its almost bitter
flavour. Something that had lain unacknowledged
in him all the day, that had
become more insistent as the dusk drew on,
something he had deliberately concealed
from himself, was now suddenly so clear
that he &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to face it. Pretence had become
childish merely. He did face it. The prospect
of sitting up all night alone in an empty
house he did not relish. &amp;quot;It's absurd,&amp;quot; he
admitted,&amp;quot;but I am, I suppose, a bit
nervous!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made his way slowly, very slowly,
across the dim Bloomsbury square in the
direction of the unoccupied mansion, turning
from time to time to see if anyone might be
following him. He would have given a
good deal to see the burly figure swinging
down the street, the black beard flying. But
pedestrians were few, and men with beards
were rarer still. The failure of his friend,
though understandable, had disconcerted
him more than he cared to admit. &amp;quot;Barring
an urgent call,&amp;quot; the doctor had said, and
the urgent call had come — an unfortunate,
rather an odd, coincidence, the young man
felt. As a specialist the doctor's time was
fairly regular, night calls an exception. An
unwelcome flavour of question, though not
yet of doubt, crept in. His old friend, he
remembered, had not exactly favoured this
expedition. &amp;quot;If you are sincere when you
say you want this experience for your new
book,&amp;quot; he had said, reluctantly, &amp;quot;all right,
then I'll come with you. If nothing happens,
at least I can study &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; The mental
specialist was not interested in so-called
hauntings, but the reactions of a human mind
under the stress of unusual emotion might
interest him. He laughed and yielded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham drew nearer and nearer to the
great empty mansion he had visited already
in the daytime; its large echoing hall he
could easily visualize, the wide creaking
staircase, the carpetless corridors, the smaller
drawing-room on the first floor where he
proposed to keep his vigil. They lay in
darkness now  — shadows, silence, emptiness,
devoid of normal occupants, at least. It
was a place that called for companionship
of a robust order. The house, with its grim,
dreadful story supported by incontrovertible
facts, stood waiting for him only a few hundred
yards down the deserted street. He
could already make out its square, uncompromising
shape, its unwashed windows
peering sideways at him. He found himself
walking slower and slower, dawdling, hesitating,
playing for time. An occasional pedestrian
passed him, and twice at least he recognized
his friend, only to discover his mistake
when they were almost abreast. A taxi
whizzed by noisily, a policeman laboriously
examined innocent doors, but the neighbourhood
lay otherwise still and heavy in
the thickish, humid June night. Gloomy it
was, the houses gaunt and gloomy too, and
the particular house that waited for him
came nearer till at last he stood opposite to
it. Instead of going in — he passed it, with
a quick glance at the staring windows. He
took a turn round the square. &amp;quot;I'll wait till
twelve,&amp;quot; he told himself. &amp;quot;When the clocks
strike midnight, I'll go in — whether Feldman
has come or not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made himself this promise, he
held to it. The policeman helped a little,
perhaps, for Pelham realized that he was a
suspicious figure, mooning about with rug
and knapsack in this desultory fashion, and
questions were the last thing he wanted.
The house soon faced him again, the policeman
a good way down the street: no one
was in sight, the clocks were striking the
hour. Walking boldly up the steps, he
inserted the key, entered the black hole that
gaped before him, and closed the door quietly
behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, perhaps, yes, but a hundred
echoes went flying none the less, as though
the place were alive with footsteps, then
dying away into the deep silence they had
broken. The darkness was at first impenetrable.
A window was open somewhere, for
the last strokes of twelve came clearly down
the stairs. And immediately, before there
had been time to move towards a plan of
any sort, there happened two disagreeable
things, both of which he could explain, but
which he disliked because they revealed too
sharply his own condition. The second of
these two he explained, indeed — with
difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, as he stood in the well of blackness,
not moving, breathing rather low,
thinking what he would do next, was a
sound close beside him; at his feet it seemed:
a curious shuffling sound, and accompanied
by a light, stroking touch upon his shoulder,
with the result that he had jumped a yard
and raised his arm to ward off a possible
blow before he realized that it was merely
the plaid rug which had slipped from his
shoulder and fallen with a faint swishing
noise upon the stone floor. He stooped and
picked it up, cursing his silly nerves. his
movement rapid, as though he felt safer in
an upright position, and it was a moment
later that the second disagreeable thing
occurred, the one he explained less easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened in this way. The instinct of
self-preservation was already automatically
at work, for while one hand picked up the
rug, the other, dropping the knapsack
clutched the flashlight in his coat pocket.
and had actually switched it on as he rose
into an upright position again. Holding it
askew, in that first second, the beam shot
along the hall floor, and the staircase went
directly in its full glare. The blaze.
however, was enough for him to catch sight
out of the corner of his eye, of  — Dr. Feldman,
black beard and all, standing motionless
peering down upon him over the banisters.
Close to the top of the first flight he was, and
the very same instant, before the beam could
show him fully, he had passed silently and
rapidly round the angle and on to the landing
above. The following beam, now turned
full after him, showed no one. Stairs, landing
and banisters were undeniably empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham did not move, he did not start,
much less did he jump; no single muscle.
in fact, stirred, The reaction was of another
kind: his heart missed a beat. Breath, at
the first gasp, was unmanageable, and at
the second — well, some vivid instinct made
silence preferable to calling out. To shout,
&amp;quot;Hullo, Max! Doctor, is that you?&amp;quot; in
the great echoing hall was impossible.
Besides — he already had found the line of
explanation — the figure was not Dr. Feldman
at all. Instinctively, even before he began
to argue, he &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it was not his friend.
There could be no answer to his call. Dr.
Feldman was not in the building with him.
No one — he almost said it audibly — was in
the building with him. The figure was
imaginary, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His critical mind, nerves or no nerves,
began instantly to argue towards firm
conviction. The sudden light, rushing
shadows distorted by startled nerves, the
fact that Feldman's personality lay vividly
in his thoughts, that he longed for him
eagerly, hoping with a kind of vehemence
that he would turn up any minute now — this
was quite enough to manufacture the
desired figure out of a sudden glare and a
flock of leaping shadows. Holding the beam
more or less steadily upon the empty stairs
and corner of the landing, he explained away
the disagreeable thing. &amp;quot;Why, even in the
street I mistook two fellows for him till I
got close enough to see my mistake!&amp;quot;
Beards, he remembered, with a faint smile,
were uncommon these days, rare enough
to make an impression. The production of
a figure with bearded face was easy enough
with flying shadows. There had been no
sound of footsteps. And, as he argued, the
premonitory shiver down his spine, while it
did not wholly pass, grew a little less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind, that is to say, provided a
passable explanation, although emotion,
being unable to argue, remained discontented
and uneasy. Emotion, he realized,
would be his problem. &amp;quot;It's always primitive,
credulous, superstitious,&amp;quot; he reminded
himself emphatically. &amp;quot;To observe its
behaviour and to note the antics of imagination
is why I'm here to-night.&amp;quot;, And wisely
then, before emotion might gain any further
advantage, he decided upon action. He
would search the house from top to bottom
before settling down to his long vigil. A
trick? A practical joke? His friend's
passionate interest in mental experiment?
The question of that &amp;quot;urgent call&amp;quot; again
flashed past and vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving his paraphernalia on the floor,
he took the pistol from the knapsack and
began at once his search of the empty
building, With firm, echoing steps, he
moved slowly up the staircase, flashing his
light in all directions as he went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large empty building is not inviting
in the darkness, nor is a flashlight,
with the contrast of inky blackness
just beyond its beam, the best way of
exploring it. The search undoubtedly
required nerve. This house, moreover, was
not merely empty; it was empty because no
one could live in it. So devoid was it,
indeed, of a pleasant living atmosphere
that two successive tenants, and that quite
recently, had chosen to die in it — by their
own hands. And the reason for their choice,
according to Pelham's investigations, added
nothing to the homeliness of the atmosphere.
Two years before them, another tenant, the
origin of the present horror apparently, had
also done away with himself, after first
doing away, in ghastly fashion, with the
rest of his family. Crazed by drugs, drink,
love, or something equally powerful and
devastating  —  Pelham had been unable
exactly to ascertain — he had been found
among the grim remnants of his fearful
orgy, strangled by his own hands. His
imitators, it was held, owed their similar
fates to his vile, terrific, posthumous influence.
Subsequent occupiers objected
strenuously, broke their leases, paid money
rather than stay, even went to court. The
house, thus, was in the market for a song —
and young Pelham was now searching its
dismal entrails at midnight with a shoddy
little flashlight. His object was to experience
at first hand, and for the purposes of a scene
in his new novel, what an imaginative man
would feel during an all-night vigil.c He
himself was an imaginative man, and he
got his &amp;quot;copy.&amp;quot; He got more besides.
The details remain the strangest among the
numerous remarkable cases in Dr. Feldman's
notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search was thorough, but unproductive.
It established the fact that there was
no one in the great dismal building save
himself. It was hardly a reassuring process
for a nervous temperament, and it called
upon all his pluck to go through certain of
the rooms — the servants' quarters, for instance,
on the top floor, the offices in the
basement, and certain large pieces that had
two doors. There was always the feeling
that someone trailed stealthily behind him,
that he was watched, that the piled shadows
concealed a figure. Once a door banged,
there were creakings everywhere, there were
groans and cracks and whispers down the
draughty passages. But the place, otherwise,
was still as death, holding its musty
smell, its gaping emptiness, its air of rather
sinister expectancy in common with most
other big unoccupied buildings. And, at the
end, Pelham stood in the hall again with the
satisfied feeling that he had done his job
faithfully, and that he could now settle
down in the small drawing-room for the
vigil proper. He had brought in a couple
of deck chairs during the day; he had his
book and candles, his coffee. Whether
Feldman came or did not come, he could
manage it. If anything happened, he now
told himself, he could manage that too.
He went upstairs and settled in. He was
calmer — yes, even quite calm. He was master
of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was here that Pelham's version (marked
in red ink in Dr. Feldman's notebooks)
first caught the attention of the specialist.
The word &amp;quot;calm&amp;quot; was underlined, a mark
of interrogation in the margin. The search
of the building should have left the nerves
on edge; instead, the reverse had happened  —
the young man had recovered his
normal quiet. He
felt &amp;quot;calm,&amp;quot; he
could &amp;quot;manage
anything&amp;quot; that
might happen
later. &amp;quot;Didn't
particularly notice
this odd calmness
in himself,&amp;quot; ran the
expert comment.
In talking it over
afterwards, Pelham
used another
adjective: &amp;quot;sedative.&amp;quot;
Uneasiness
had gone, he
declared, &amp;quot;just as
though I'd taken
a sedative and it
was beginning to
work. I observed
everything
keenly,&amp;quot; he tried
to explain, &amp;quot;but
things that half
an hour before
would have
startled and made
me jump  —  well,
they just didn't.
I watched them
happen, missing
nothing, but
without any nasty
reaction, horror
least of all. I was
prepared for anything
I might see.
Like being doped
almost.&amp;quot; And in
the doctor's notebook,
on this point, is an interesting
and suggestive comment: &amp;quot;This curious
preliminary calmness, though P. noticed
it suddenly, came on gradually no doubt.
He was aware of it only when achieved.
His own word 'sedative' indicates slow
approach. Morbid excitement had passed
completely, but acute observation nowhere
impaired. He felt 'prepared' for what
might follow. A &lt;em&gt;preparation&lt;/em&gt;!?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- {{The deck-chair was occupied by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame, black beard and all.}} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man, now settled comfortably
in his deck-chair, a rug over
his knees, the two candles on a packing-case
behind his head, sat reading his book
with one part of his mind, while, with
another part, he stared, listened, watched,
every muscle and nerve in alert tension, yet
wholly at his ease. His original jumpiness
had vanished, nervousness was gone, had
exhausted itself perhaps. Opposite to him
was the unoccupied chair intended for his
friend. Two blindless windows on his right
gave upon roofs and a night-sky too hazy
for stars to show. On his left, wide open,
was the door through which the top of the
staircase, with the few feet of banisters the
sham Dr. Feldman had peered over, was
just visible. The carpetless room had no
stick of furniture, the blank walls marked
only with lines of dirt where pictures and a
large mirror had been hung. A glass chandelier
above his chair sparkled faintly in
the flickering candle-light. The light, of
course, was poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he sat reading while the hours
passed and the night drew towards morning.
From time to time he pricked his ears;
creakings on the
stairs, cracks
of wood on the
floors above,
sounds in the big
hall below, those
he noticed without
a qualm, but
attributed quite
rightly to their
natural causes.
No purpose, no
intent, no meaning,
living or posthumous,
could be
ascribed to them.
Nothing approaching
a footstep,
much less a voice,
broke the deep
silence that
wrapped the
building from roof
to kitchen. Yet
his composure was
remarkable rather,
considering his
temperament and
his recent jumpiness.
And the
young man felt
disappointment
growing on him.
Even if he saw
and heard nothing,
he had hoped for
unusual reactions
of interesting kind.
These did not
come. After his
first bout of rather
boyish &amp;quot;nerves,&amp;quot;
his recording apparatus,
imaginative
or critical,
registered —
nothing. His experiment
seemed
a failure; the
scene in his book
would gain no verisimilitude from the
description of an actual experience. He
even began to feel glad that Dr. Feldman
after all had not wasted a night's
sleep for nothing. Even if he saw a
figure now, his attitude would be one
merely of critical examination: could
he touch it as solid, walk through it,
could it answer questions or show intelligence
in response to his advances,
his calm, collected, cross-examining  advances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman! He put his book
down, Ah! He had almost forgotten
him. The first keen longing, the bitter
disappointment, these, too, had left him.
He realized that, for a considerable time
now, he had not been alertly waiting for
his footstep, his voice, his brown eyes.
This expectancy had left him too. This
indifference, this forgetfulness, Dr. Feldman
also stressed in his own notebook — as a
proof that Pelham's mind was no longer
working normally. &amp;quot;Noticed his own
indifference,&amp;quot; ran the comment in red ink,
&amp;quot;but not particularly surprised at it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dr. Feldman!&amp;quot; And Pelham abruptly
realized, for the first time, that he had
forgotten to leave the key outside the front
door. Completely overlooked it! Even if
Dr. Feldman had come, he could not have
got in. Perhaps he had already come — and
gone. He would probably not have rung,
much less would he have knocked. Possibly,
indeed, reflected Pelham, the doctor might
welcome the excuse and go home to bed.
Well, it didn't matter, the young man
thought, as he went down cautiously in the
dark to remedy his oversight, but leaving
his electric torch on the packing-case. There
was nothing of interest here for his clever,
learned friend. He was relieved, in fact,
to have no critical observer of his own
disappointment, of this flat, uneventful, and
rather foolish night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key in hand, he opened the big door and
peered out into the deserted street. It was
between two and three in the morning; soon
the grey light would come in the sky. No
one was to be seen. He paused a moment,
standing on the step, then came back inside,
shutting the door carelessly, and with a
good deal of echoing noise, but again forgetting
to leave the key outside, an omission
only realized long afterwards. He started
to cross the hall. A faint light from his
open door above filtered down, so that the
banisters were just visible. And it was as
he crossed the hall that someone brushed by,
and passed in front of him up the staircase.
Though no actual touch was registered, he
was quite positive of this. Whether he
actually heard the steps he could not
swear, but that someone who had been
standing close beside him in this dark
hall now moved up the stairs ahead of him,
he was convinced beyond any possible
doubt. Had there been doubt, indeed, it
was at once negatived, for a second later he
saw the outline of a man slip along the
banisters overhead and move rapidly along
the landing. The outline disappeared towards
the door where the faint light issued. The
person, whoever it was, had gone into his
room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelham went after this figure; he climbed
the stairs very quickly, almost ran along
the short stretch of landing, and, without a
sign of hesitation, entered the room himself.
&amp;quot;I burst into it, in fact,&amp;quot; he described it
afterwards. &amp;quot;And there, in the chair
opposite to mine,&amp;quot; he said, with intense
conviction, &amp;quot;sat — yourself. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;, Max, sat
in that chair.&amp;quot; The deck-chair was occupied
by Dr. Feldman, big shoulders, burly frame.
black beard and all. The head was sunk a
little forwards, down upon the chest rather;
the eyes were closed; the breathing was
regular and sounded heavy. &amp;quot;You looked
asleep, though naturally I knew this was
impossible.&amp;quot; And in his written version,
Pelham, describing his own reaction to this
&amp;quot;bit of nonsense,&amp;quot; emphasized his impatient
resentment that a &amp;quot;friend like you,
Max, should have played this trifling, rather
dangerous trick upon me.&amp;quot; He felt sore,
even angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For in that first instant of inspection.
young Pelham realized that the doctor had
somehow secreted himself in the house from
the beginning, that the &amp;quot;urgent call&amp;quot; was
a thought-out detail, that it was, in fact, an
ill-judged practical joke. He remembered
his own first fugitive doubt. Dr. Feldman
was not going to lose a night's sleep for
nothing; he had always meant to make
use of the occasion to give his romantic
friend a shock, then study his nervous
reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Pelham resented the trick, its perilous
foolishness in view of his own nerves
and the fact that he had a pistol. So much
did he resent it that, taking his own chair
again, he sat there staring at his friend, a
kind of dull anger in him, giving no single
thought as to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the doctor had contrived
his trivial little plan. He did not speak, he
made no attempt to tackle him about it.
he did not even prod him out of this idiotic
pretence of being asleep. He just sat and
stared, this sullen, rather sulky anger in his
heart. He felt no relief that his friend had
come and now sat before him; he no longer
needed him, nor was his presence comforting.
Comfort, even companionship, of that sort
he did not want any more. Deep annoyance,
contempt to the point of bitterness almost,
was all he felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman, it seems, meanwhile
kept up this game of his with a steady
perfection that, the other felt, would
have been admirable in a better cause. He
maintained his pose of sleep without a flaw.
It was good acting. No sign of expression
showed itself in his face. The body was
limp with the relaxation of a man in deep
slumber. And the longer young Pelham
watched him, the more his angry vexation
grew. His thought found words such as
&amp;quot;Idiot, imbecile,&amp;quot; phrases like &amp;quot;Amazing
trick for a man like you, a great mental
specialist, to play&amp;quot; — and finally, after
perhaps half an hour of this persistent folly
on the &amp;quot;specialist's&amp;quot; part of silence and
immobility, since it betrayed no sign of
explaining itself, Pelham took up his book
again and went on reading. He was furious,
yet wanted to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic, no doubt, the situation was, but
he was in no mood to appreciate its comedy.
He obstinately refused to speak, and in his
mind now was a sort of boyish determination
that he would meet the other at his own
game, and beat him at it too! He made
no sign, no sound. He merely read. The
minutes passed. Perhaps half an hour slipped
by, perhaps longer. His obstinacy remained
cast-iron. Dr. Feldman, for his part, also
kept up the nonsense; he aped slumber to
perfection; his breathing was heavy, heavy;
the black beard rising and falling with the
movement of his chest; the brown eyes
always tightly closed — till at last, the
sound of a clock striking the hour came
faintly into the room where these two sat.
Pelham counted the strokes, and they were
three. There was a gleam of dawn. He
looked up suddenly from his book, hardly
knowing why —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this time he started. His blood
ebbed, then came back with a rush. What
was it? What did it mean? At the first
sight, in this faint early light, Dr. Feldman
looked precisely as before, ordinary, normal:
at the second, he looked —  amazing. Every
atom of attention Pelham could muster
concentrated in his eyes. He stared till they
smarted, But his spine ran icy cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a difference, yet this difference
remained concealed. At the first glimpse it
was Max Feldman who faced him; at the
second, it was someone else. Thus he phrased
it in his written version, and the brevity was
significant. Here was something, apparently,
he could not describe. He shivered all over.
The former queer insensitiveness, the numbness,
had begun to pass. The &amp;quot;sedative &amp;quot;
effect was leaving him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, staring with all his energy, with all
available concentration, at his familiar
friend, he knew himself dreadfully overwrought.
Yet that &amp;quot;second glimpse &amp;quot;
refused to come back; the amazing
aspect of this well-known shape kept
hidden. He &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; seen it, however. It was, he
divined, still there. The blood gushed and
ebbed alternately; his feet, his back were
cold. He was &amp;quot;all on edge,&amp;quot; like a terrified
girl, The figure in the chair, so far as he
could analyse, had not altered; the burly
frame, the broad shoulders, the black
heard, the eyes closed in &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; remained
as before. &amp;quot;The idiot,&amp;quot; he tried to say,
&amp;quot;still pretends,&amp;quot; but his thought refused to
frame the words — because they were somewhere,
somehow false. &amp;quot;Idiot&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;asleep,&amp;quot; at any rate, were merely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His written description of what followed
was extremely, curiously brief. His own
eyes remained glued, unable to move. He
stared and stared. The beard moved up
and down with the slow heaving of the great
chest, the relaxed body betrayed no tension,
the head sank forwards and downwards as
before. Then, suddenly, that &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;
glimpse, that &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; aspect came stealing
horribly back. The face, hitherto devoid
of expression, had begun to change. It was
slowly altering. Black and white entered
into it somehow, a white that was passionless,
a black that was diabolical. The
mouth, under the dark hair, sagged; the
eyebrows took a slanting twist, the jaw
beneath the beard thrust out. It became,
slowly but decisively, an entirely different
and an atrocious face. The mask slipped
gradually downwards from it. And young
Pelham, now bereft of power to move,
stared helplessly at the appalling change.
He was staring, he tried to tell himself, at
something he could not believe, something
that was not possible, something that
human experience cannot admit. But yet
he witnessed it. And he could not move his
eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Feldman, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Max Feldman, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
my friend,&amp;quot; his thought struggled to cry
out, then realized vaguely that thought
was stifled in him, no longer operating.
Thought and volition had simultaneously
disappeared. And the head then suddenly
moved a little to one side. It slowly shifted.
The beard, at a new angle, now revealed the
neck. There was no collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tried to scream, to shriek, but breath
failed him. Horror dropped over him like
ice. He trembled from head to foot. The
shuddering was audible, his teeth clattered,
his feet tapped the wooden floor. But he
still stared helplessly, because sight was
riveted beyond any power of his that could
either move his eyes or close them. He
became aware then that this demoniacal face
that aped his friend was about to change
still further. How he knew this lay beyond
him. He did know it. A faint quiver of the
cheeks betrayed it, possibly. Something
ghastly ran across the skin. He knew the
eyes were going to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There came a further movement of the
head. It lolled to one side — frightfully. The
collarless neck was creased with dull red
lines. The same instant the two eyes opened,
giving back his own awful, fascinated stare.
They were bright, fixed, maniacal eyes.
Moreover, they were not brown, but black.
They gazed into his own with murder in
their depths. And the whole figure then
gave a convulsive shudder and began to
alter visibly like the face. With extreme
swiftness, as in a cinema, this alteration
supervened. The great frame seemed suddenly
to have grown emaciated, the big
shoulders sank and drooped, only the black
beard still flowed down the collarless neck
that was marked with its hideous red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- {{Facing him on the step, an electric torch blazing in his hand, stood Dr. Feldman}} --&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the outline rose. Leaving the
chair without visible effort, it stood
up, it wavered a moment, half staggering,
half lurching; the arms projected
abruptly; the hands opened long, muscular
fingers that moved through the air toward
his throat. He saw the eyes behind them —
like shining lamps — close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tremendous clamour that broke
here with its sudden clashing gave him, it
seems, the power to move his muscles. A
bell rang furiously, there was a violent
banging on a door. The building echoed.
The awful figure, though it did not seem to
pause in its advance, came, singularly, no
nearer actually to his face and throat. A
measure of volition, startled into activity
perhaps by the resounding noise, returned
to him. He sprang up, he shrieked as
though his heart had burst, he staggered
but he reached the door. He was down the
steps in what seemed literally a couple of
enormous leaps, and across the dark hall.
The same second he was fumbling at the big
front door, where the knocking sounded.
He opened it. Facing him on the step, an
electric torch blazing in his hand, stood —
Dr. Feldman. He came in, closing the door
behind him with a bang. &amp;quot;Frightfully sorry,
old man, but it took me longer than I
thought. You forgot the key —&amp;quot; was all
young Pelham heard before darkness fell
over him and he fainted in his friend's arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swoon, rather than a faint, it was,
lasting perhaps a minute. A sip of brandy
from the doctor's flask brought the blood
back to normal ways. There followed
confused talk, questions, and somewhat incoherent
answers, and then — Dr. Feldman
insisted firmly on this — the visit to the room
upstairs. They went together, side by side,
arm in arm in fact, into an entirely empty
room. The candles stood guttering on the
packing-case, electric torch and pistol beside
them, a book on the floor, and a couple of
unoccupied deck-chairs opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But young Pelham, shaking from head to
foot, white as chalk, found no very intelligent
words, and the specialist, thoroughly at home
among conditions of this kind, took him
home, administered a mild sedative, and
read at his leisure some days later the
account of Pelham's night. He had insisted
on a written version first. Talk followed, a
little study of his own as well, but this was
for his private notebooks, as were also two
facts he took some trouble to ascertain —
namely, that the murderer used drugs on
his victims as on himself, and also, oddly
enough, that his maniac face held black eyes
and was adorned with a black beard into
the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimble was not too proud to fight, but he was too old, too
stiff, too blind; he could not drill properly, because he really had
to think a moment before he knew which was his left and which
his right. There are some men who can positively do nothing; he
was one of them. With the best intentions in the world, burning,
zealous intentions too, he was yet useless. Unable to help, he
lost that comfort which comes the moment one's smaller burden is
merged in the collective burden of the nation. That peace being
denied him, his interest in the war on the other hand being intense,
he merely — &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;. Morning, noon, and night, he read. He
read all the papers, but on Sunday he read only four, not counting
&amp;quot;extras.&amp;quot; Sunday was his day off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He plunged with the ease of a bird from the heights of optimism
to the depths of pessimism. It wore him out. He believed
everything he read. Every move made on the great chess-board
was a clever trap into which either the enemy or the Allies would
march blind-eyed. He yearned to warn the latter. In time, however,
the &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; idea collapsed; it never came off; the lure was
non-existent. A certain paper declared that the enemy would
never be caught without its glasses … he gave up buying it for
a week, then surreptitiously went back to it because it &lt;em&gt;proved&lt;/em&gt; that
the Germans were using their last reserves. A bad communiqué
could keep him awake at night, so could a very good one.…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Eastern and Western fronts, at length, he switched
off upon the Balkans, till he became so entangled that he — well,
though his walls were covered with maps, he never could remember
even whether Roumania was north of Bulgaria, or vice versa;
nor which country claimed Bucharest or Sofia as its capital. Invariably
he had to inspect his maps. Bucharest, since it began
with B, ought to belong to Bulgaria; sometimes, judging by the
telegrams, it did, sometimes, judging by the articles, it didn't.
The Balkans became a gigantic jig-saw puzzle, all corners and
curves and points and angles that would not fit. The coloured
flags pricked his fingers, the maps got stained, the strip of carpet
below them grew threadbare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time he confined himself to picture-papers, till he read
that most of the scenes were made somewhere in Surrey, or taken
from manoeuvres of five years ago. He flung himself next upon
strategy and diagrams of positions, till the chintzes on his chairs
expressed surprise and peril, and the very blood in his strained
eye-balls mapped the empty air with danger. Reality faded from
the world. He himself &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; up the street or &amp;quot;retired&amp;quot;
to his bedroom. On the way to his bath he muttered left, right,
left, left, left — halt, then had to &amp;quot;retreat in perfect order&amp;quot; for
his forgotten sponge and towel. He confined himself in the last
resort to &amp;quot;official news.&amp;quot;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This called for grim restraint, but the truth was he was getting
a little frightened. His speech showed signs of trouble, and sounds
became audible in his head occasionally — z … sz … scz … czs …
and pmj or mjp … and the like. He became aware of showers of
them sprinkling almost visibly through the air — in the darkness,
explosive, spitting sparks. They even pricked him. His tongue
and throat grew sore. And there were other symptoms that
alarmed him. The worst, perhaps, was the mute j. He had somehow
got full of them without knowing it, either swallowed them or
breathed them in, he knew not which; but in any case he was interiorly
somewhat crowded with soft heaps of these mute j's.
They were akin to microbes of a suppressed illness; for any
moment — it was horrible to think of — they might emerge, appear,
themselves, become not mute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; doing, Dimble?&amp;quot; asked Spriggins at the
Club one day, good-naturedly. Spriggins, though bald and
crooked, wore &amp;quot;G. R.&amp;quot; and a big red armlet every Sunday on
route marches that nearly killed him. Dimble looked up helplessly
into his face. He answered. Speech of a kind, at least,
came twanging, buzzing from his lips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ceskz … kivitch … ski … kzs … z . z. z. jjjjjjj!&amp;quot;
he replied. His voice cracked oddly; tiny explosions were audible
inside his chest; his throat held soda-water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not notice how Spriggins got away; he &amp;quot;retreated,&amp;quot;
apparently in good order. It was certainly a rapid movement.
Spriggins was not surrounded, at all events. And he left Dimble
standing there as though he had been burned, destroyed, utterly
devastated till nothing of any value remained inside his outer
physical frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters had grown so serious by this time that he made a prodigious
effort, and renounced all papers whatsoever — for an entire
day. For twenty-four hours he read no news, no expert articles,
no forecasts, no résumés, no analyses of the Balkan soul, nor one
single report from a neutral traveller just returned from everywhere.
He did not even look at a line from an official or diplomatic
source whose authority it is impossible to doubt. He
moved no single pin upon his many maps. He lay in darkness —
he also lay in bed. He starved. A strange hunger woke in him:
He knew an intolerable emptiness. He slept a little, however,
and murmured in his sleep — for it was troubled — &amp;quot;Official news,
official news … csz .. ksz .. j.j.j.…!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimble recovered a bit and lived his life as best he could. He
was careful now, not to say cautious. He reconnoitred before
every single act; also he deployed. But things went rather quickly
after that. He slept by day in a darkened room, and went out
only in the night. He could not see the posters thus; the paper
man at the corner, who now cut him dead instead of smiling cheerfully,
could be avoided. This was the serious stage for Dimble.
By the candlelight in his bedroom he noticed curious marks upon
his arm; the skin seemed mottled. He said, &amp;quot;Bites, by Nicholas!&amp;quot;
and thought of queer, invisible insects. Yet the marks
apparently traced a pattern; they had design, meaning, almost
rhythm. They were horribly familiar. And then he knew — they
were j's. The mute j's were coming out! &amp;quot;Spies!&amp;quot; he cried in
terror. &amp;quot;I'm betrayed! I've harboured spies! All this time
they've been in my very midst! He knew he was done for then,
but he did not fully realise his ghastly position until, the following
night, he detected further marks. They were quite distinct.
He easily made them out in the dark. He saw &amp;quot;Official …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a dreadful business. He could not tell a soul, because
his communications were all cut. He faced the worst with courage;
no one should say he was a coward or a slacker. He ordered
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the papers again, and sat reading them by daylight in his
room. He went boldly to the Club and read them openly,
brazenly, with true defiance. He agreed with everything he read,
he understood it all, but he had no feelings now, he was neither
optimistic nor the reverse. He simply read. … It was odd, but
no one noticed him. In his room one day the landlady came in to
brush and sweep — she ignored his presence, tidying the papers up
all round him as though he were not there at all. The same thing
happened at the Club. A waiter even tried to smooth him out
and hang him on the file, and once he was nearly — oh, it was
wicked — nearly picked up and offered to another member, Spriggins.
Only, luckily, Spriggins had the decency to refuse him.
He did it so nicely too: &amp;quot;No, thanks,&amp;quot; he said with a little
smile, &amp;quot;I've read it. There's nothing in it, anyhow!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was that very night when Dimble woke towards the early
hours, and heard a crackling as he turned in bed. Terror gripped
him. He lay quite still and listened. It was at the end of the
bed apparently — a faint swishing, crackling noise with tiny reports
accompanying it. He moved his foot; the sound was repeated.
Something glimmered dimly. He moved the other foot, his arm
as well, he sat up briskly. There was a leaping rush of the vague
white form across the air; with a tap and slither it fell upon the
floor beside him. He stooped over to pick it up, and his hand
came into contact with something smooth and warm that was in
the act of settling upon the floor. He felt the little wind it made.
It was, of course, a newspaper. But the same instant, and before
he removed his hand, he knew by the warmth of it that it was
something more besides. It was not different from himself. What
in the world had happened to him? It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; himself. His hand
was on the skin of his bare chest. He was crackling all over —
but very nicely, very crisply. He settled back into bed with a kind
of rush and slither. His terror passed. He felt well pleased with
himself. &amp;quot;It's all right,&amp;quot; he murmured, as he fell asleep. &amp;quot;For
a moment I thought I was a halfpenny one! I must be more careful.
Near shave, that! I must mention it to Spriggins … when
I'm out!&amp;quot; There was an odd smell of printers' ink in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning he came out duly, and Spriggins bought him
for a penny, right enough, and took him in his pocket on a long
route march. While resting for lunch with his company, out by
the Welsh Harp, which is 'Endon Wy', he lit his pipe with him.
Dimble tried to utter a protest, but he stammered horribly. He
could not get his words at all. He made a fizzy, crackling noise
instead — of which Spriggins, puffing the smoke at him, took no
slightest notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Dimble curled up, turned slowly black and passed away
into the wind and fell into a stubble-field near by, and lay there
quite happily until the dew that night came softly down and dissolved
him into nothing — nothing visible or of value at any rate.
.. BODY_END&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the aspects of this author’s singular style of writing is that it sounds as if it is the product of a prior age. Since the author wrote over a century ago, this is unsurprising to present-day readers. Yet, it seems even his contemporaries found the author’s writing to be antiquated—old-fashioned. This suggests the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Why?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having heard such a question, one who writes might well feel some instinctual need to compose an answer. One who writes fiction will feel no particular need for that answer to be truthful. Better it should be unnatural and just a little weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having come to the metropolis to find inspiration, the narrator instead finds disappointment and declares the city dead.
He feels no kinship with its denizens.
Between the populace and the city they inhabit, he senses only the same kinship as exists between a hermit crab and the dead creature, in whose shell it makes its home.
By a revenant embodiment of the old city, he is shown that its past and future are shaped by the same pattern as its present—and the author comes to discover that he, too, is adrift from his natural place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading this story, the post-postmodern reader may feel an impulse to respond to the author’s sense of alienation from his environment and its inhabitants by naming him misanthrope—or worse—and take this judgment of misanthropy away as the story’s chief significance.
Like returning from the grocery store with the latest issue of the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, but having left all the groceries on the shelves, this is perhaps a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

Lovecraft at Wikisource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This text begins a story, in which an eldritch book precipitates the narrator’s unmooring from the usual relationship that any natural creature shares with space and time.
This new relationship is manifest outwardly as a previously non-existent shadow—a preternatural extension of the narrator smeared into the physical world—and inwardly in his bewilderingly altered perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was written in 1933, 28 years after the &lt;em&gt;Annus Mirabilis&lt;/em&gt; in which the public first learned of what comes to be called Minkowski spacetime.
That Time is not the sugary frosting on a 3-layered cake of Space, but is instead sugar co-equal with the flour, eggs, and butter, which make up the cake &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;, is an idea truly mind-bending to any—such as the author—who seeks to wrap his mind around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackwood—who influenced Lovecraft—took on the weird subject of spacetime—after its publication in 1905—in &lt;em&gt;Entrance and Exit&lt;/em&gt; (1909), &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Found Out&lt;/em&gt; (1912),  &lt;em&gt;A Victim of Higher Space&lt;/em&gt; (1914), and &lt;em&gt;The Pikestaffe Case&lt;/em&gt;  (1914).
How Lovecraft’s treatment differs from Blackwood’s is that Lovecraft’s narrator speaks from &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that experience, rather than &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; that experience.
An ambitious undertaking, it was perhaps too ambitious, as the story was not completed by its author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Esperanto-English Using Standard Ebooks Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-book glossary entry ordinarily consists of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term to be defined: stored as the dt-term in a dl-description-list, contained in glossary.txt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definition: stored as the dd-description in a dl-description-list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synonyms and variations of each term, connecting them to that term: stored as a search-key-map in glossary-search-key-map.xml.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, a glossary is used by a user looking up a word in the text, when this word is encountered. Also, it is significant that the glossary-search-key-map is not well-supported by existing readers and the glossary is intended to work around this limitation, providing good function, while also functioning properly when the support is widely available. These goals are accomplished by using the following formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="text-glossary-xhtml"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;text/glossary.xhtml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glossary file contains a description list with one dt-dd pair per term, in alphabetical order. Using the example, for each entry, make the following replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the term:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;Abdul Alhazred&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; term being described.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;abdul-alhazred&lt;/em&gt; as the id with the lower-case, dash-separated, no-diacritics version of this term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the description:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;em&gt;Abdul-Alhazredo&lt;/em&gt; inside the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; element with the Esperanto transation of the term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;, colon, and space; provide a brief, simple, and consistently arranged Esperanto definition of the term. Do not include any links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the second paragraph, after the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; list all words, separated by comma, in either language which correspond to this definition. Exclude the two words already given. Include variations in tense, number, possessive, etc. that appear in the work and consider include alternate spellings found in Wikipedia. Do not tag these words to indicate their language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;be the same.&lt;/dd&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Abdul Alhazred&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Alhazred&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the key-map is not yet well supported by ebook readers. The &amp;quot;Also&amp;quot; line in the glossary is intended as
a workaround. These items are intended to be hidden, though the reading device may present them anyway. But by listing here, the reader should bring up the glossary item during search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="css-local-css"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;css/local.css&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three items here are SE styles, meant to show the glossary items in a good way. The remaining items
are meant to make the English and Esperanto words easy to distinguish during search and in the final document. It is meant to hide the extra
synonyms but present them well in a a helpful way if the reader-device does display them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first Mardi Gras was 20 years ago, on my birthday—New Orleans being a place that truly embraces the spirit of my birthday—and for some time, from within a crowd across the street, just after dusk had given way to night; I saw, then watched, the ghostly-blue visage of what seemed to be a woman's face, perfectly still, as it hung in the darkness of an empty Garden District balcony; eyes downcast, unseen, a faint eldritch glow that did not penetrate the surrounding gloom: her expression somber, pensive, maybe even mournful; up above, but not watching, the flambeaux that bobbed, and oblivious to the drums that boomed, parading through the street below—too unreal to be real, yet too real to be anything else—and because the brain itches when it can make no sense of what the sight claims to see, I squinted my eyes, twisting them up, trying to make her corporeal; to manifest her into the world of the living, to shelve her into a warehouse of things, or to send her away entirely to the realm of the fanciful, until finally, she lowered her phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victorian ghosts haunt stairwells, attics, and moors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern ghosts haunt their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mia unua Karnavalo estis antaŭ 20 jaroj, en mia naskiĝtago—Nov-Orleano estante loko kiu vere brakumas la spiriton de mia naskiĝtago—kaj dum iom da tempo, de homamaso trans la strato, tuj post kiam la vesperkrepusko estis cedinta al nokton; mi vidis, tiam rigardis, la fantome-bluan aspekton de tio, kio ŝajnis esti vizaĝo de virino, perfekte senmova, dum ĝi pendis en la mallumo de malplena Ĝarden-Kvartala balkono; okuloj rigardantaj malsupren, neviditaj, malforta preternatura brilo kiu ne penetris la ĉirkaŭantan mornon: ŝia esprimo serioza, pripensema, eble eĉ funebra; supren de, sed ne rigardardante, la torĉoj kiuj balanciĝis, kaj nekonscia pri la tamburoj ke tondris, paradante laŭ la strato sube—tro nereala por esti reala, tamen tro reala por esti io ajn alia—kaj ĉar la cerbo jukas sin kiam ĝi povas fari neniun sencon de tio, kio la vidado asertas vidi, mi strabigis miajn okulojn, tordante ilin streĉe, provante enkorpigi ŝin; manifesti ŝin en la mondo de la viva, enbretigi ŝin en magazeno de objektoj, aŭ forsendi ŝin tute al la regno de la fantazia, ĝis finfine, ŝi malsuprenigis sian poŝtelefonon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant difference between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit" target="_blank"&gt;Brexit (2020)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation" target="_blank"&gt;English Reformation (1534)&lt;/a&gt; has been the character of the reaction from the Continent. To the former, it was one of "&lt;i&gt;I'm never gonna let you go&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Let_You_Go_(Dionne_Warwick_song)" target="_blank"&gt;(Well &amp;amp; Mann, 1982)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while to the latter, it has been more "&lt;i&gt;hit the road, Jack, and don't ya come back, no more&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_the_Road_Jack" target="_blank"&gt;(Mayfield, 1960)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From history, e.g. the withdrawal of the North American colonies from the British Empire (1776) and the secession of the Confederate States from the United States (1861), it seemed reasonable to image that any member seeking to depart from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" target="_blank"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; — once it had been formed — would prompt a continent-wide war — called either revolution or civil war, depending the outcome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When history repeats, this is to be expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it fails to repeat, this is to be appreciated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog-en"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="history"></category></entry><entry><title>Vintro Alvenis</title><link href="vintro-alvenis-eo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Paul King</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-01-17:vintro-alvenis-eo.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="align-center figure"&gt;
