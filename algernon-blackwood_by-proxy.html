<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>The November fog drifted in oily spirals
over the region of Gorston Square.
It hung obstinately, reluctant to be
disturbed. In Victorian days the Square
had been almost fashionable. Rich merchant
princes and rising barristers inhabited
its rather grim-looking houses, where now
there was hardly a single private dwelling
to be seen. The old buildings had sunk
into cheap boarding-houses or small hotels
of doubtful character, with a few bleak
erections converted into so-called modern
flats. No wonder the fog lingered and felt
at home in Gorston Square. It offered cover
to more than one transient who welcomed
cover.</p>
<p>On the steps of the dingiest of these
hotels, the Gorston Arms, stood a man who
had all the appearance of one of these uneasy
transients. He seemed part of the fog and
gloom and murk: a tall, dark man with
hunched shoulders, a pasty, discoloured face
and shifty eyes. A scar ran from his jaw
across the left cheek almost to his ear, a
scar he cursed bitterly because no medical
skill had been able to obliterate it. It had
been acquired several years before in Denver
City from a razor-blade, fixed in a potato,
and its grim signature, intended for his
throat, had been diverted only because his
famous left arm had been a fraction of a
second too quick. That famous pugilist's
left had saved his life, but for a crook like
Lefty Holt it was a damaging mark to carry.</p>
<p>Lefty was glad of the fog that night, as
he stood on the steps of the Gorston Arms
and sniffed the choking air. Looking right
and left, he eyed the street uneasily, watching
the few figures that moved so cautiously
about their business through the murk.
What was their business, was the question
he asked himself. He preferred to see them
moving rather than just loitering. For
Lefty knew, with the strange, keen instinct
of the hunted, that for days he had been
shadowed. The fellow gangsters he had
&quot;let down&quot; in Denver City were on his
trail. He was being followed, and this
uncanny instinct of the hunted would not
let him rest. He had spotted no one in
particular, but he was positive they were
on his heels. He had been tracked across
the water, for they knew that, as a Britisher,
he would make for London. The warning
whisper ran through his bones and blood:
his temporary hotel was no longer safe. A
chance caller, and before he even knew what
the visitor wanted, the knife would be in
his ribs. He must at once find lodgings
where he could more easily check new
arrivals.</p>
<p>Lefty Holt, crook and double-crosser,
hid behind the shelter of the porch and
studied the roadway carefully, peering about
him into the welcome fog. Few people,
thank God, were on the move, but he would
not venture forth till he made quite sure
there was no suspicious figure loitering on
a corner. A postman passed on his rounds,
sure of each familiar step; a youth on a
bicycle, obviously some clerk hurrying home
to his supper or high tea; a blind man tapping
along the pavement by the Square railings,
safer than any pedestrian, since darkness
was his natural condition. A rare taxi
crawled slowly by. The outlook seemed
safe enough—reasonably safe.</p>
<p>Lefty slipped out swiftly, and in a moment
the fog had swallowed him up. In his
pocket lay one or two addresses he had
sifted that morning from likely papers. He
moved rapidly. He did
not make the mistake
of looking behind him
or over his shoulder,
but his eyes, for all
that, were wide open
in his back, nerves
and instinct as alert
as a wolf's. The
postman, the clerk,
were gone, and the
blind man went as
before, tapping his
dreadful stick, though
the note had slightly
changed, and the taps
came at longer intervals.
He, too, was
moving away. Two
men slid out from the
doorway of an office-building
lower down
the street and disappeared,
but they,
too, went in the opposite
direction. The
blind man no longer
tapped, for he was
round the corner.
Lefty felt safe. He
could go now and
inspect the lodgings
he had in view.</p>
<p>Nor was the region unfamiliar to him.
It was here in boyhood he had learned his
first pick-pocketing; the police court a
few hundred yards beyond the Square he
remembered, too; against these very railings
on fragrant summer nights he had courted
the girl he took later to Colorado as his wife,
a crook even smarter than he was himself.
His face darkened at the thought. Mean-hearted
double-crosser though he was, the
knowledge that she in turn had given him
the same treatment filled his heart with
vicious rage. She had got away with it,
too, stones and all, his own share into the
bargain. Yet she, too, he reflected, if she
ever got clear of the Denver City gang,
would make for these same parts and comparative
safety. Beasts in danger, he knew,
invariably return to their familiar haunts
where &quot;hides&quot; and funk-holes are known
to them. Thoughts and memories ran on
through his mind in their nasty circle.</p>
<p>He almost collided with a burly figure in
blue standing motionless beneath a lamppost,
and instinctively his coat collar went
up to hide that scar.</p>
<p>&quot;Evening, mate,&quot; he said gruffly, without
turning his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Thick night, ain't it?&quot; came the answer,
as Lefty passed on quickly.</p>
<p>But a policeman had no terrors for him
at the moment, though it was just as well
his face should not be recognised. He was
not &quot;wanted&quot; here. He had done no
violence in his early days, only the lesser,
meaner crimes … and ten minutes later
he tried the first address in his list, only to find
that the room advertised was already taken.
Luck failed him at the next house, too; and
at the third he rang and rang for some
time without an answer. He tried the
knocker, for he was getting impatient, and
waiting, he felt, was dangerous. Though
the fog was now so thick that it was difficult
to see even across the street, or ten yards
along the pavement, he felt exposed and
defenceless, as though he stood naked on
the doorstep Yet he persisted, for some
instinct told him this was the house he
wanted. The door opened suddenly but
cautiously, a few inches only. He liked
that caution, it confirmed his instinct.</p>
<p>&quot;What d'you want 'ere?&quot; came a harsh
voice in his ear, no face yet visible. It
was a woman's voice.</p>
<p>For an instant, Lefty almost lost his self-possession,
but for an instant only. If
anyone should know that voice, he should
He had heard it last in Denver City some
years ago, but he could never fail to recognise
it. It went through him now like a flash
of steel or fire. The hair on his spine, so
to speak, stood up. Questions and suspicions
blazed in him. Had she followed him?
Had she, too, made her own get-away?</p>
<p>&quot;Who's in there with you—Lizzie?&quot;
his snarling voice asked with a filthy oath.</p>
<p>&quot;N-no one,&quot; came the reply, after an
instant's hesitation he did not fail to notice.
&quot;But I don't want you,&quot; she snapped,
trying to shut the door in his face, without
success, for his foot had already jammed
it. A second later he had forced his way
inside and slammed the door behind him,
and the horrid pair stood facing one another
in the dim-lit little hall.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no good, kid,&quot; said Lefty, in a
voice now ominously softer. &quot;We got to
have a show-down, you and me,&quot; and he
gave her a cruel blow across the mouth with
the famous left that had earned him his
name. As the woman, scared to death,
staggered back against the hat-rack, protecting
her face from further blows that,
however, did not follow. Lefty swept the
hall with quick, cunning eyes. No hat,
he saw, was hanging there, though that did
not mean there was no man about. He
might just be out. His hand strayed to his
left arm-pit.</p>
<p>&quot;And where's Shearer?&quot; he asked
again, in that ominous soft voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead,&quot; whispered the woman, white
with terror, &quot;these two years gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Lefty examined her face very closely in
the dim light for some seconds.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>&quot;He's lucky,&quot; he observed. &quot;Maybe
he had a sweeter death than what I had
waiting for him.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman, shivering from head to
foot, said nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only one thing I want from
you, Lizzie,&quot; Lefty went on threateningly,
&quot;but I want it quick. You two sure played
me for the blind sucker I was. Where are
the stones?&quot; He slipped the gun neatly
from his armpit.</p>
<p>The woman's voice had gone, so that
it was barely audible. &quot;Upstairs,&quot; she
managed to whisper, pointing overhead with
a hand that shook like a leaf. &quot;I kept
your share for you, Lefty, all this time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like hell you did,&quot; snarled Lefty with
an ugly grin.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get them for you,&quot; came her terrified
whisper, with eyes on the pointing gat
in his hand, as she began to move. After
a moment's hesitation, Lefty decided to
let her go alone. Knowing her as he did,
he felt her terror was real, and instinct
assured him there was no man in the
house.</p>
<p>&quot;And move fast,&quot; he told her savagely,
fingering his gun. &quot;No funny stuff, either,
or you'll get what's coming to you,&quot; he
added, with a flood of blasphemy, as he
watched her backing clumsily up the stairs.
&quot;Too hot to cash in, I suppose,&quot; he threw
after her, referring to the stones,&quot; too hot
for a — — like you!&quot;</p>
<p>A nasty expression ran down his lop-sided
face like a streak of fire or poison. He
watched her go, counting each step as she
stumbled up, yet his eyes simultaneously
everywhere in turn, his ears intent for the
slightest suspicious sound. He said no
further word. He felt certain she still
had the stones, or some of them, and would
bring them down. He saw her turn the
corner along the dark, narrow landing, and
when she was out of sight, though still
listening closely to the sound of her footsteps,
he turned away and looked cautiously
about him.</p>
<p>A door faced him, and he flung it wide
open with a rapid sudden gesture, but he
did not enter the room till he was quite
certain it was empty. He saw a fire burning
in the grate, a round table in the centre
with books lying open and a few children's
toys. A wooden elephant, a golliwog, a
tiny aeroplane, lay beneath his eyes. A
child's room, obviously.</p>
<p>&quot;She's got a kid, I do believe,&quot; darted
across his mind. &quot;And Shearer's, by God,
unless I'm crazy!&quot;</p>
<p>He was surprised at himself. After all
this time—what could it possibly matter?
But—it did matter. For the blood in his
veins boiled up till it almost frothed. Never
before had he felt such a storm of wild,
animal rage. Ungovernable fury rose in him,
yet with it something cold as ice, a combination
that made the blood ebb and flow
strangely, making the scar across his face
a livid streak, the face itself a devil's
face.</p>
<p>He listened. Overhead he could hear
her shuffling about, drawers being opened,
furniture moved, but there was no one with
her, and only one pair of feet went stumbling
across that upper floor. He was quite
positive of that. He kept his wolf's ears
divided between that upper floor, the corridor
outside and the front-door step. His gat
was ready pointing for instant use if
needed.</p>
<p>Then a door opened suddenly in the hall,
and he froze to attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Mummie, where are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The reply came down: &quot;In a minute, darling! Coming!&quot;
And a little boy entered the room, smiling and unafraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you the new lodger?&quot; asked the little fellow, as he
looked the tall stranger over with a fearless eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, no—I guess not,&quot; said Lefty in his gentlest voice.
&quot;I just called in to see your ma. You see,&quot; he added, &quot;I used
to know her a long time back.&quot;</p>
<p>The child listened with rather an examining expression, then
turned his eyes to his toys on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Look what she gave me for my birfday,&quot; he exclaimed proudly,
unearthing something Lefty had not noticed before among the
others. &quot;A real pistol, like they have in the movies. Isn't it
grand? Hands up, or I shoot!&quot; he added, trying to look fierce
and determined.</p>
<p>Lefty was watching the child closely, his face working.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, say!&quot; he cried, &quot;isn't that just fine! It covers the
heart every time, don't it just!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet it does,&quot; laughed the child, playing with it.
And Lefty knew. The same eyes, the same ears, the same set
of the head upon the neck. It was Shearer's kid all right. The
child of his pal, the pal who had stolen his wife, his share of the
jewel-robbery as well, and skipped, leaving him, Lefty, to dodge
the cops and make his get-away as best he could without a cent.
There was no doubt about it in his mind. The proof faced him
here and now, and his blood rose to its maximum of bitter fury.
Only one idea lay in his being—revenge</p>
<p>He heard Lizzie's footsteps stumbling down the stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick,&quot; he said to the boy, with a smile, taking his gun from
his pocket, &quot;we'll play your mother a grand trick. It's a great
idea. You take my pistol—it's just a toy like yours, only
heavier and bigger—and when she comes in you just point it at
her and cry, &quot;Hands up, you villain!&quot; and then fire. And she'll
fall down and pretend to be dead just like they do in the movies.
And then I'll arrest you, and we'll all laugh together! What
d'you say, boy—eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that'll be fun!&quot; cried the boy, eagerly taking the
automatic Lefty handed to him.</p>
<p>&quot;It sure will,&quot; agreed Lefty, putting the catch at ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, it's ever so much heavier than mine.&quot; said the little
fellow admiringly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. It's the latest toy-model,&quot; Lefty told him. &quot;Hold it
steady against that book now. There! That's fine. Then point
straight, and pull the trigger quick, remember. It'll go quite easy!&quot;</p>
<p>The woman came in with a large envelope in her hand. &quot;Here
they are,&quot; she whispered, glancing a moment at her child as
though in uneasy surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Hands up, you villain!&quot; she heard in the boy's excited voice.</p>
<p>The pistol cracked. She slithered to the floor, the envelope
fell towards Lefty's feet. He stared at it a moment, watching
the blood pouring from the woman's mouth, then swiftly picked
it up, stuffed it into his pocket, and passed out into the hall.
The pistol he deliberately left behind him. A moment later he
was lost in the fog outside, the excited laughter of the boy still
ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Shearer's kid,&quot; he muttered, wiping the icy perspiration from
his forehead. &quot;And serve her damn well right! She got what
was coming to her at last!&quot; But he was trembling from head
to foot.</p>
<p>He moved fast, soon entering Gorston Square. He would find
a room to-morrow. The fog was thicker than ever. So much
the better, he thought, clutching the big envelope tightly in his
pocket and feeling the hard edges of what it contained. There
was no single pedestrian about, though he heard again the
tapping of that blind man's stick as he fumbled along by the icy
railings. And this time he did not like the sound. A violent
shiver ran over him. At the corner two other lost pedestrians
came towards him. They slipped up uncomfortably close, one
