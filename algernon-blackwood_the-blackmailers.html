<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>Alexander's experience with the blackmailer was
unique‚Äîit happened once only.</p>
<p>He had been happily married for some years,
with two children, and was doing well enough in
his insurance business. Life, indeed, was quite rosy,
when one day a stranger called at the office and
asked to see him alone. This stranger was an elderly
man of perhaps rather shabby appearance, but his
face and manner were quite engaging, and he had
a really pleasant smile. His voice was cultured. He
was obviously a gentleman, a university man
probably. At the same time, there was something
about him that hesitated; he seemed shy, a trifle
nervous even. In spite of the worn, cheap clothing,
however, he made the best impression, and Alexander
believed that a bit of good business was coming his
way.</p>
<p>They went into the inner private room. The interview
began in the bluntest possible way. Something
very determined had come into the stranger's manner,
almost as though he had screwed himself to say what
he came to say and meant to see it through.</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Lawson,&quot; he announced, &quot;and I
need money badly.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke rapidly, yet with a curious reluctance,
as though he said something he had learned by
heart and rather hated saying. &quot;Some letters of
yours,&quot; he went on‚Äî&quot;it doesn't matter how‚Äî
have come into my possession. If you will give me
¬£20, they're yours.&quot; And he drew from his pocket
a small packet, fluttering them before the other's
eyes so that the handwriting was plainly visible.
The hand that held the letters shook.</p>
<p>The shock to Alexander, instead of the pleasant
surprise he had rather expected, was overwhelming.
With one look he had recognized the paper and the
handwriting. He blenched. A cold sweat broke out
on him. He was not naturally a man of much nerve
and he realized that a bluff of any sort was useless.
He had written those letters. He was frightened to
the bone. All he could do in that first instant was
to stagger to a chair, for his legs were too weak
to support him. He just sat down. The other man
remained standing, keeping a certain distance.</p>
<p>&quot;T-twenty pounds,&quot; stammered Alexander, half to
himself, trying vainly to collect his thoughts. He
was shivering visibly. Hot and cold he was. He knew
he was quite helpless. This was blackmail.</p>
<p>&quot;And I'll hand them over,&quot; Lawson was saying.
Then he added, as though relieved to say it: &quot;And
you'll never set eyes on me again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But‚ÄîI‚ÄîI haven't got it,&quot; went on Alexander in
a panic, his mind flooding with pictures of his wife,
his children, his happy home. &quot;It's impossible‚Äî
utterly impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you can get it,&quot; suggested Lawson quietly.
And though his voice sounded determined, merciless
even, there was that odd touch of reluctance again
in his manner, as though he was ashamed to say the
words. He stood there on the office carpet, watching
his victim's face, giving him time apparently.
Putting the letters back into his pocket, he waited
in silence. A hint of contempt, it may be, lay in
this silence, contempt for the other's craven attitude
and lack of fight. And Alexander somehow was
aware of this, even while he tried frantically to
think out ways and means. He would have paid
¬£1,000, let alone ¬£20, to have those letters back
and see them burn. But where could he find ¬£20
at a moment's notice? Though recovering a little
from the first awful shock, his mind worked badly.
He did think once of the Law which allowed a
plaintiff in a blackmail case to conceal his name.
He also thought of threatening to go to the police
at once. Only the pluck to carry the bluff through
failed him‚Äîand he knew it. He was so terrified,
so painfully anxious to get those letters back that
he kept his mind chiefly on the ¬£20 and where in
the devil he could find it. The name of a pal who
might lend it crossed his bewildered mind at last.</p>
<p>&quot;If you will come back in an hour, in half an
hour even,&quot; he said at last in a low, stammering
voice, &quot;I‚ÄîI think I can have it for you.&quot; Without
knowing exactly why, he suddenly added then:
&quot;You're a‚Äîgentleman, I see.&quot; The words came on
their own accord. Lawson lowered his eyes. He
didn't answer. &quot;If you go out,&quot; he said then quietly,
&quot;I'm afraid I must come with you. I'm sorry‚Äîbut
‚Äîyou understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I understand‚Äîof course,&quot; said the
other.</p>
<p>In the end this is what happened. They went out
together. Alexander, greatly to his surprise, got his
¬£20. They came back together, always side by side.
Alexander handed over the money and took the
letters in his hand. He counted them. He was
shaking so violently that he had to count them a
second time. One, two, three! The cold sweat broke
out on him afresh.</p>
<p>&quot;Three,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Is that <em>all</em> you've got?&quot;</p>
<p>Lawson, he saw, actually blushed. He was already
at the door on his way out. &quot;I think so,&quot; he replied,
forcing the pleasant smile on to his face as he told
the deliberate lie. &quot;I'll look again when I get home,
and if there is another you shall have it.&quot;</p>
<p>The expression on the face startled Alexander, for
behind the forced smile, behind the sudden blush,
was misery‚Äîabject misery. The hideous shame was
clear to see, but the grim determination too.</p>
<p>&quot;Another ‚Ä¶ ?&quot; repeated Alexander.&quot; But you've
got a lot more‚Äîa dozen at least ‚Ä¶ &quot; he cried.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>But Lawson was gone.</p>
<p>Alexander sat motionless for some minutes,
clutching the letters feverishly as though they
might be snatched away. He had gone to pieces
badly. How the man had come into possession of
the horrible letters puzzled him utterly. But that
did not matter: he <em>had</em> got them, and he, Alexander,
had written them‚Äîoh, a dozen at least, perhaps
two dozen. Twenty pounds for three! With more to
follow! He thought of his wife, his children, his
happy home. ‚Ä¶ He thought of Lawson‚Äîhis voice,
his manner, his whole attitude. A gentleman, yes,
a man of education and refinement. That sudden
blush, the nervous, deprecating air, the reluctance,
the look of shame. A man ashamed of yielding to
the temptation chance has put in his way, eager
to get away the moment the hideous deal was over
and the money in his pocket. Yet a man, Alexander
now began too late to realize, he might have bargained
and pleaded with. The fellow's better nature
was plain to see‚Äîunderneath.</p>
<p>Alexander cursed himself for his collapse and
lack of pluck. A bold front, a threat of the police,
and Lawson in his turn would have weakened,
possibly collapsed himself. A good bluff and Alexander
might have got those letters‚Äîall of them,
not merely three‚Äîfor nothing.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. He realized he still sat
clutching his three letters, and that it was office
hours and he had much to do. But the instant he
was free again, he quickly locked the door and lit
a match. He burnt the letters‚Äîwithout reading
them‚Äîand smudged the black ashes into dust in
his waste-paper basket.</p>
<p>Still trembling with the shock and horror of it
all, he could not work. He took the afternoon off,
walking feverishly round and round the parks,
thinking feverishly, but without result. The night
at home was the most miserable he had ever known,
the children on his knee, the wife he loved beside
him. If he slept at all, he hardly knew it. He had
come, however, to a decision‚Äîto two in fact.
And next day he went to a solicitor, putting a
hypothetical case before him. But the strong advice
to go straight to the police was beyond his powers.
Even as &quot;Mr. X,&quot; he could not face a trial. His
second decision was to plead with Lawson, plead for
time at any rate. The man had a better nature he
felt he could appeal to. He would do this‚Äîthe next
time. For he knew, of course, there would be a
next time. Lawson before long would call again.</p>
<p>But Lawson did not call again. After weeks of
unspeakable terror and anguish, a letter came, to
his home address this time. It was very brief, the
handwriting rather suggesting the scholar.</p>
<blockquote>
I <em>have</em> come across another letter. Perhaps you would prefer
to call for it yourself. A fiver would meet the case. I do not
wish to cause unnecessary pain. It is, apparently, the only one.</blockquote>
<p>The address was in Kilburn, and Alexander took
five Treasury notes and went, one thing comforting
him a little‚Äîthe obvious fact, namely that Lawson
was not a thoroughgoing and experienced blackmailer,
or he would never have taken risks and laid
himself open to such an easy trap. In his mind he
had already rehearsed what he meant to say. His
plea would be as moving as only truth could make
it. But he planned a threat as well, a bluff of course,
but a bluff that would sound genuine‚Äîthat if
driven to kill himself, he would leave the evidence
behind him and Lawson would be at once arrested.</p>
<p>He could be firm this time, with the firmness of
a desperate man. Desperate indeed he was, but
firmness did not belong to his weak, impulsive,
rather nerveless type.</p>
<p>Expecting a block of cheap flats, or a single room
in a mean lodging-house, he found instead a small
detached building, quite a decent little place, and
a deaf old woman admitted him, announcing him
by name, into a room that looked half study, half
library. For it held numerous books, and a writing-table
was covered with papers. Lawson, at the far
end of it, stood to receive him. But the interview
hardly went according to plan, for as Alexander
handed over the Treasury notes and received the
letter in exchange, the other again took the cash as
with a kind of shrinking, horrible reluctance. He
was trembling, his face was very white, his voice,
as he said &quot;Thank you,&quot; trembled too. And before
Alexander could recover from his moment's surprise
and bring out either his plea or his threat, Lawson
was speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in a terrible position myself,&quot; he said in a
very low voice, &quot;<em>Terrible.</em>&quot; His face expressed real
anguish. &quot;With any luck,&quot; he went on in a whisper,
his eyes on the floor, &quot;I would repay you‚Äîone day.&quot;</p>
<p>He placed the notes in a drawer of his desk, while
Alexander's eye, watching the movement, read the
titles of some books above: a volume of Matthew
Arnold's poems, a Greek lexicon, Gibbon's <em>Decline
and Fall</em>. But it was Lawson's sign of weakness
that then helped the other to find some, at least,
of the words he had meant to use. It was the bluff
that rose first to the surface of his bewildered mind.</p>
<p>&quot;You know‚Äîthat I can go to the police,&quot; he
heard himself saying.</p>
<p>The other looked sideways towards the window,
so that Alexander caught the face at a new angle.
He noticed the ravaged expression. Lawson was
suffering intensely.</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; came the reply calmly, without turning
the head. &quot;But you wouldn't‚Äîany more than I
would.&quot;</p>
<p>The conviction in the words, their truth as well,
confused and bewildered the wretched victim still
more. His thoughts scattered hopelessly. He said
the first thing that came into his head. All idea of
a plea for mercy had vanished.</p>
<p>&quot;If you drive me to kill myself‚Äîand I'm near it
now‚Äîyou'd be arrested at once. I could leave the
proofs.&quot;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It was the way Lawson shrugged his shoulders
that completed his feeling of utter hopelessness. It
had dawned upon him suddenly that Lawson's
position was somehow similar to his own, his desperation
as dreadful. Lawson himself was at the last
gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got a lot more, of course?&quot; he heard
himself asking in a faint voice.</p>
<p>Lawson now turned and faced him. His expression
was awful, if pitiful at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; he whispered, and his manner
again showed that deep reluctance, with a sort of
shame and horror against himself. &quot;One or two‚Äî
I'm afraid,&quot; he repeated. He drew a heavy sigh
and put up his hand to hide his eyes. &quot;I'm
frightfully sorry,&quot; he muttered, half to himself. He
was trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>The interview was over. Alexander left the house
an utterly hopeless man. The situation was now
clear to him, of course. Lawson, normally a decent
fellow probably, was being blackmailed himself.
Alexander understood, he even sympathized, but
with this understanding vanished the last vestige also
of any hope. He realized now <em>precisely</em> how desperate
Lawson was.</p>
<p>The ghastly suffering and anguish of the weeks
and months that followed need no description‚Äîhis
sleeplessness, his frantic resorts to finding cash, the
moneylenders, his wife's discovery that something
very serious was wrong, the way he fobbed her off
with a story of bad business. The visits to Kilburn
were repeated and repeated, though the interview
usually took place in silence now. Money was paid,
letters were handed over‚Äîwithout a word, both
men, indeed, seemed approaching the last gasp. As
for Alexander, he found it difficult to believe that
he had written so many letters. But he had.</p>
<p>The cumulative effect at last broke his life to
pieces. His health was gone, his mind became queer.
Turning frantically to one desperate plan after
another, all of them useless, he was driven finally
into that dreadful, final corner where an Emergency
Exit seemed inevitable. And this was not nerve, it
was merely the ultimate decision of an utterly
ruined, ordinary man. He bought a pistol. In his
mind came the mad suggestion that it was as easy
to end two lives as one. He went to the little Kilburn
house for the last time. This was definitely to be
his last visit. He took no money with him, but in
his hip-pocket lay the Browning with three cartridges
in the chamber‚Äîthe third in case of mischance.</p>
<p>Exactly how he intended to act was far from clear
to him. He had rehearsed no plan. That time was
past. The loaded pistol lay in his pocket. He left
the rest to impulse.</p>
<p>It was an evening in late October, summertime
now over, and dusk spread over the dreary Kilburn
streets. He came straight from the office by Tube.
After leaving the train he walked very rapidly.
Then he broke into a run, with the feeling that the
faster he went the sooner the awful thing would
be over. He arrived panting, reaching the house
almost before he knew it. He was utterly distraught,
his mind, even his senses, behaving wildly, inaccurately.</p>
<p>There was no answer to the violent pull he gave
the bell, the deaf old woman did not appear, and
then he noticed for the first time that the front door
stood ajar. And he just walked in. The tiny hall was
empty too. He closed the door behind him and
walked across to the library. Only too well he knew
it. There was no need to be shown in. He was
expected. And he was punctual. Six was striking.</p>
<p>The house, it then occurred to him, was exceptionally
quiet. There was an extraordinary stillness about
it‚Äîa stillness he didn't like. There was also‚Äîthough
he only recalled this afterwards‚Äîa faint odour of a
peculiar kind. Giving a loud knock without waiting
for an answer, he opened it the same instant and
walked straight in without further ado.</p>
<p>He saw Lawson at once. He was not standing as
usual, but sitting facing him in the leather armchair
with its patches of untidy horsehair sticking out.
And he declares that the moment his eyes rested
on him a disagreeable shudder ran down his spine.
It was not the shudder of loathsome anxiety he
knew so well, but something he had never felt
before. Distracted, half crazy though his mind undoubtedly
was at the time, it took in one thing at
least quite clearly. Lawson looked different. He had
changed. Wherein this alteration lay exactly Alexander
could not say. He only knew that it frightened
him in a new way and that his back had goose-flesh.
An awful fear crawled over him.</p>
<p>Lawson not only looked different‚Äîhe behaved
differently. He did not get up, but sat in the chair
staring into his visitor's face. There was something
wrong, not merely different. And Alexander stopped
dead just inside the door, forgetting even to close
it behind him. He stood there spellbound, returning
the stare. His first instinct was to turn tail and run,
only his legs felt suddenly weak, his control of the
muscles gone. He held his breath. What amazed
him more than anything else was the expression on
his enemy's face. For it wore a happy, kindly smile;
the ravaged, suffering look had left it, there lay
a curious soft pity on it. Unaccountably, he felt his
heart beginning to swell. He could not take his eyes
from that happy, pitiful face, that motionless figure
in the chair. It was perhaps two minutes, perhaps
only two seconds, before he heard the voice.</p>
<p>For Lawson spoke‚Äîin a scarcely audible whisper.
There was obviously a tremendous strain and effort
behind the whisper, as though he could only just
manage it: yet Alexander heard every syllable
distinctly.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't need that pistol, either for me or for
yourself. I have posted the others to you‚Äîwith what
‚Äîmoney I had. ‚Ä¶&quot; and the whisper died away
into silence. The lips still moved, but no sound came
from them. Lawson himself had not moved at all‚Äî
he had not made even the smallest movement‚Äî
once.</p>
<p>There was a sound in the hall, and Alexander
involuntarily turned his head an instant. He recognized
the deaf woman's shuffling tread. Turning
back to the room again almost the same moment,
Lawson the blackmailer was no longer staring at
him from the leather chair. He was not in the chair
at all. He was not even in the room. The room was
empty. The only visible living person in it was
himself, Alexander.</p>
<p>It flashed across him, as the deaf servant came
stumbling through the door behind him, that he
had gone crazy, that his mind was gone. There was
icy perspiration all over him. He was shaking
violently. He heard the old woman's words in a
confused jumble only, but their meaning was plain
enough. Lawson, she was trying to tell him, had
shot himself several hours ago ‚Ä¶ but had not
killed himself ‚Ä¶ the police ‚Ä¶ doctors had come
‚Ä¶ there had been an anaesthetic ‚Ä¶ he had
been taken away ‚Ä¶ but had died in the ambulance.</p>
<p>Alexander does not remember how he got out of
the house. All he remembers is walking the streets
furiously, for hours even, and somewhere or other
telephoning to his wife that he was detained and
would not be home till after dinner. He knows he
did that. He knows also that on reaching the house
very late, he talked incoherently to his frightened
wife, that the children were long since in bed and
asleep, and that his wife put a registered packet
into his trembling hands in due course. He knows
too that it contained several letters he had written
years before to another woman‚Äîdreadful, damaging
letters‚Äîthat a couple of twenty-pound notes fell at
his feet, and that the postmark on the label was
11.30 Kilburn that very morning.</p>
