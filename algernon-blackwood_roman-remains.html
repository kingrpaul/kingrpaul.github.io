<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>Anthony Breddle, airman, home
on sick leave from India, does not
feel himself called upon to give an
opinion; he considers himself a recorder
only. The phrase <em>credo quia impossibile</em>,
had never come his way; neither had
Blake's dictum that &quot;everything possible to
be believed is an image of truth.&quot;</p>
<p>He was under thirty, intelligent enough,
observant, a first-rate pilot, but with no
special gifts or knowledge. A matter of
fact kind of fellow, unequipped on the
imaginative side, he was on his way to convalesce
at his step-brother's remote place in
the Welsh mountains. The brother, a much
older man, was a retired surgeon, honored
for his outstanding work with a knighthood
and now absorbed in research.</p>
<p>The airman glanced again at the letter
of invitation;</p>
<p>&quot; ‚Ä¶ a lonely, desolate place, I'm afraid,
with few neighbors, but good fishing which,
I know, you adore. Wild little valleys run
Straight up into the mountains almost from
the garden, you'll have to entertain yourself.
I've got lots of fishing rods for you.
Nora Ashwell, a cousin you've never met,
a nurse, also on sick leave of sorts but shortly
going back to her job, is dying for companionship
of her own age. She likes fishing
too. But my house isn't a hospital! And
there's Dr. Leidenheim, who was a student
with me at Heidelberg ages ago, a delightful
old friend. Had a Chair in Berlin, but
got out just in time. His field is Roman
Culture ‚Äî lots of remains about here ‚Äî but
that's not your cup of tea, I know. Legends
galore all over the place and superstitions
you could cut with a knife. Queer things
said to go on in a little glen called Goat
Valley. But that's not down your street
either. Anyhow, come along and make the
best of it; at least we have no bombing
here. ‚Ä¶&quot;</p>
<p>So Breddle knew what he was in for
more or less, but was so relieved to get out
of the London blitz with a chance of recovering
his normal strength, that it didn't
matter. Above all, he didn't want a flirtation,
nor to hear about Roman remains from
the Austrian refugee scholar.</p>
<p>It was certainly a desolate spot, but the
house and grounds were delightful, and
he lost no time in asking about the fishing.
There was a trout stream, it seemed, and a
bit of the Wye not too far away with some
good salmon pools. At the moment, as rain
had swollen the Wye, the trout stream was
the thing to go for; and before an early
bed that night he had made the acquaintance
of the two others, Nora and Emil Leidenheim.
He sized them up, as he called
it: the latter a charming, old-fashioned man
with considerable personality, cautious of
speech, and no doubt very learned; but
Nora, his cousin, by no means to his taste.
Easy to look at certainly, with a kind of
hard, wild beauty, pleasant enough too, if
rather silent, yet with something about her
he could not quite place beyond that it was
distasteful. She struck him as unkempt,
untidy, self-centered, careless as to what
impression she made on her company, her
mind and thoughts elsewhere all the time.
She had been out walking that afternoon,
yet came to their war-time supper still in
shorts. A negligible matter, doubtless,
though the three men had all done something
by way of tidying up a bit. Her eyes
and manner conveyed something he found
baffling, as though she was always on the
watch, listening, peering for something that
was not there. Impersonal, too, as the devil.
It seemed a foolish thing to say, but there
was a hint in her atmosphere that made
him uncomfortable, uneasy, almost gave him
a touch of the creeps. The two older men,
he fancied, left her rather alone.</p>
<p>Outwardly, at any rate, all went normally
enough, and a fishing trip was arranged
for the following morning.</p>
<p>&quot;And I hope you'll bring back something
for the table,&quot; his brother commented,
when she had gone up to bed. &quot;Nora has
never yet brought back a single fish. God
knows what she does with herself, but I
doubt if she goes to the stream at all.&quot; At
which an enigmatic expression passed across
Dr. Leidenheim's face, though he did not
speak.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is this stream?&quot; his brother
asked. &quot;Up that Goat Valley you said was
queer, or something? And what did you
mean by 'queer'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, not Goat Valley,&quot; came the
answer; &quot;and as for 'queer,' I didn't mean
anything particular. Just that the superstitious
locals avoid it even in the daytime.
There's a bit of hysteria about, you know,&quot;
he added, &quot;these war days, especially in
god-forsaken places like this ‚Äî &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God-forsaken is good,&quot; Dr. Leidenheim
put in quietly, giving the airman an impression
somehow that he could have said
more but for his host's presence, while
Breddle thought he would like to tap the
old fellow's mind when he got the chance.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>And it was with that stressed epithet in
his ears that he went up to his comfortable
bedroom. But before he fell asleep
another impression registered as he lay on
that indeterminate frontier between sleeping
and waking. He carried it into sleep
with him, though no dream followed. And
it was this: there was something wrong in
this house, something that did not emerge
at first. It was concerned with the occupants,
but it was due neither to his brother,
nor to the Austrian archaeologist. It was
due to that strange, wild girl. Before sleep
took him, he defined it to himself: Nora
was under close observation the whole time
by both the older men. It was chiefly, however,
Dr. Leidenheim who watched her.</p>
<p>The following morning broke in such
brilliant sunshine that fishing was out of
the question; and when the airman got down
to a late breakfast he was distinctly relieved
to hear that Nora was already out of the
house. She, too, knew that clear skies were
no good for trout; she had left a verbal
excuse and gone off by herself for a long
walk. So Breddle announced that he would
do the same. His choice was Goat Valley,
he would take sandwiches and entertain
himself. He got rough directions from Dr.
Leidenheim, who mentioned that the ruins
of an ancient temple to the old god, Silvanus,
at the end of the valley might interest
him. &quot;And you'll have the place to yourself,&quot;
said his brother, laughingly, before
disappearing into his sanctum, &quot;unless you
run across one of the young monsters, the
only living things apparently that ever go
there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsters! And what may you mean by
that?&quot;</p>
<p>It was Dr. Leidenheim who explained
the odd phrase.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he said, &quot;nothing at all. Your
brother's a surgeon, remember. He still
uses the words of his student days. He
wants to scare you.&quot;</p>
<p>The other, finding him for once communicative,
pressed him, if with poor results.</p>
<p>&quot;Merely,&quot; he said in his excellent English,
&quot;that there have been one or two unpleasant
births during these war years ‚Äî in
my language, <em>Missgeburt</em> we call them. Due
to the collective hysteria of these strange
natives probably.&quot; He added under his
breath, as if to himself, something about
<em>Urmenschen</em> and <em>unheimlich</em>, though
Breddle didn't know the words.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he exclaimed, catching his meaning
&quot;that sort of thing, eh? I thought they
were always put out of the way at birth or
kept in glass bottles ‚Äî &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In my country, that is so, yes. They do
not live.&quot;</p>
<p>The airman laughed. &quot;It would take
more than a <em>Missgeburt</em> to scare me,&quot; he
said, and dropped the unsavory subject before
the old archaeologist got into his stride
about the temple to Silvanus and Roman remains
in general. Later he regretted he had
not asked a few other questions.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Now, Anthony Breddle must be known
as what is called a brave man; he had
the brand of courage that goes with total
absence of imagination. He was a simple
mind of the primitive order. Pictures passed
through it which he grouped and regrouped,
he drew inferences from them, but
it is doubtful if he had ever really thought.
As he entered the little valley, his mind
worked as usual, automatically. Pictures of
his brother and the Austrian flitted across
it, both old men, idling through the evening
of their day after reasonable success,
the latter with a painful background of bitter
sufferings under the Nazis. The chat
about collective hysteria and the rest did
not hold his interest. And Nora flitted
through after them, a nurse maybe, but an
odd fish assuredly, not his cup of tea in
any case. Bit of a wild cat, he suspected,
for all her quiet exterior in the house. If
she lingered in his mind more vividly than
the other two it was because of that notion
of the night before ‚Äî that she was under
observation. She was, obviously, up to
something; never bringing in a fish, for
instance, that strange look in her eyes, the
decided feeling of repulsion she stirred in
him. Then her picture faded too. His emotions
at the moment &quot;were of enjoyment and
carefree happiness. The bright sunny
morning, the birds singing, the tiny stream
pretending it was a noisy torrent, the fact
that &quot;Operations&quot; lay behind him and
weeks of freedom lay ahead ‚Ä¶ which
reminded him that he was, after all, convalescing
from recent fevers, and that he
was walking a bit too fast for his strength.</p>
<p>He dawdled more slowly up the little
glen as the mountain-ash trees and silver
birch thickened and the steep sides of the
valley narrowed, passed the tumbled stones
of the Silvanus temple without a glance of
interest, and went on whistling happily to
himself ‚Äî then suddenly wondered how an
echo of his whistling could reach him
through the dense undergrowth. It was not
an echo, he realized with a start. It was a
different whistle. Someone else, not very
far away, someone following him possibly,
someone else, yes, was whistling. The realization
disturbed him. He wanted, above
all, to be alone. But, for all that, he listened
with a certain pleasure, as he lay in a patch
of sunshine, ate his lunch, and smoked, for
the tune, now growing fainter, had an enticing
lilt, a haunting cadence, though it
never once entered his mind that it was
possible a folk tune of sorts.</p>
<p>It died away; at any rate, he no longer
heard it; he stretched out in the patch of
warm sunshine, he dozed; probably, he
dropped off to sleep ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yes, he is certain he must really have
slept, because when he opened his eyes he
felt there had been an interval. He lay now
in shadow, for the sun had moved. But
something else had moved too while he
was asleep. There was an alteration in his
immediate landscape, restricted though that
landscape was. The absurd notion then intruded
that someone had been near him
while he slept, watching him. It puzzled
him; an uneasy emotion disturbed him.</p>
<p>He sat up with a start and looked about
him. No wind stirred, not a leaf moved;
nor was there any sound but the prattle of
the little stream some distance away. A
vague disquiet deepened in him. Then he
cupped his ears to listen, for at this precise
moment the whistling became audible again
with the same queer, haunting lilt in it.
And he stiffened. This stiffening, at any
rate he recognized; this sudden tautening
of the nerves he had experienced before
when flying. He knew precisely that it came
as a prelude to danger; it was the automatic
preparation made by body and mind to meet
danger; it was ‚Äî fear.</p>
<p>But why fear in this smiling, innocent
woodland? And that no hint of explanation
came, made it worse. A nameless fear could
not be met and dealt with; it could bring
in its wake a worse thing ‚Äî terror. But an
unreasoning terror is an awful thing, and
well he knew this. He caught a shiver running
over him; and instinctively then he
thought he would &quot;whistle to keep his courage
up,&quot; only to find that he could not
manage it. He was unable to control his
lips. No sound issued, his lips were trembling,
the flow of breath blocked. A kind
of wheeze, however, did emerge, a faint
pretence of whistling, and he realized to
his horror that the other whistler answered
it. Terror then swept in; and, trying feebly
again, he managed a reply. Whereupon
that other whistling piper moved closer in,
and the distance between them was reduced.
Yet, oh, what a ravishing and lovely lilt it
was! Beyond all words he felt rapt and
caught away. His heart, incredibly, seemed
mastered. An unbelievable storm of energy
swept through him.</p>
<p>He was brave, this young airman, as
already mentioned, for he had faced
death many times, but this amazing combination
of terror and energy was something
new. The sense of panic lay outside
all previous experience. Genuine panic
terror is a rare thing; its assault now came
on him like a tornado. It seemed he must
lose his head and run amok. And the
whistler, the strange piper, came nearer, the
distance between them again reduced.
Energy and terror flooding his being simultaneously,
he found relief in movement. He
plunged recklessly through the dense undergrowth
in the direction of the sound,
conscious only of one overmastering impulse
‚Äî that he <em>must</em> meet this piper face to face,
while yet half unconsciously aware that at
the same time he was also taking every precaution
to move noiselessly, softly, quietly,
so as not to be heard. This strange contradiction
came back to memory long afterwards,
hinting possibly at some remnant of
resisting power that saved him from an
unutterable disaster.</p>
<p>His reward was the last thing in the
world he anticipated.</p>
<p>That he was in an abnormal condition
utterly beyond his comprehension there can
be no doubt; but that what he now witnessed
registered with complete and positive
clarity lay beyond all question. A figure
caught his eye through the screen of leaves,
a moving ‚Äî more ‚Äî a dancing figure, as he
stood stock still and stared at ‚Äî Nora Ashwell.
She was perhaps a dozen yards away,
obviously unaware of his presence, her
clothes in such disorder that she seemed
half naked, hatless, with flowers in her
loosened hair, her face radiant, arms and
legs gesticulating in a wild dance, her body
flung from side to side, but gracefully, a
pipe of sorts in one hand that at moments
went to her lips to blow the now familiar
air. She was moving in the direction away
from where he stood concealed, but he saw
enough to realize that he was watching a
young girl in what is known as ecstasy, an
ecstasy of love.</p>
<p>He stood motionless, staring at the amazing
spectacle: a girl beside herself with
love; love, yes, assuredly, but not of the
kind his life had so far known about;
a lover certainly ‚Äî the banal explanation of
her conduct flashed through his bewilderment
‚Äî but not a lover of ordinary sort.
And, as he stared, afraid to move a step,
he was aware that this flood of energy, this
lust for intense living that drove her, was
at work in him too. The frontiers of his
normal self, his ordinary world, were trembling;
any moment there might come collapse
and he, too, would run amok with
panic joy and terror. He watched as the
figure disappeared behind denser foliage,
faded then was gone, and that he stood
there alone dominated suddenly by one
overmastering purpose ‚Äî that he must escape
from this awful, yet enticing valley, before
it was too late.</p>
<p>How he contrived it he hardly remembers;
it was in literal panic that he raced
and stumbled along, driven by a sense of
terror wholly new to all his experience.
There was no feeling of being followed,
nor of any definite threat of a personal
kind; he was conscious more of some power,
as of the animal kingdom, primitive, powerful,
menacing, that assaulted his status
as a human being ‚Ä¶ a panic, indeed, of
pagan origin.</p>
<p>He reached the house towards sunset.
There was an interval of struggle
to return to his normal self, during which,
he thanked heaven, he met no member of
the household. At supper, indeed, things
seemed as usual ‚Ä¶ he asked and answered
questions about his expedition without hesitation,
if aware all the time, perhaps, that
Dr. Leidenheim observed him somewhat
closely, as he observed Nora too. For Nora,
equally, seemed her usual, silent self, beyond
that her eyes, shining like stars, somehow
lent a touch of radiance to her being.</p>
<p>She spoke little; she never betrayed herself.
And it was only when, later, Breddle
found himself alone with Dr. Leidenheim
for a moment before bedtime, that the urgent
feeling that he <em>must</em> tell someone about
his experiences persuaded him to give a
stammering account. He could not talk to
his brother, but to a stranger it was just
possible. And it brought a measure of relief,
though Leidenheim was laconic and
even mysterious in his comments.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes ‚Ä¶ yes ‚Ä¶ interesting, of
course, and ‚Äî er ‚Äî most unusual. The combination
of that irresistible lust for life, yes,
and ‚Äî and the unreasoning terror. It was
always considered extremely powerful and
‚Äî equally dangerous, of course. Your present
condition ‚Äî convalescing, I mean ‚Äî made
you specially accessible, no doubt. ‚Ä¶&quot;</p>
<p>But the airman could not follow this kind
of talk; after listening for a bit, he made
to go up to bed, too exhausted to think
about it.</p>
<p>It was about three o'clock in the morning
when things began to happen and the
first air raid of the war came to the hitherto
immune neighborhood. It was the night
the Germans attacked Liverpool. A pilot,
scared possibly by the barrage, or chased by
a Spitfire and anxious to get rid of his
bombs, dropped them before returning
home, some of them evidently in the direction
of Goat Valley. The three men, gathered
in the hall, counted the bursts and
estimated a stick had fallen up that way
somewhere; and it was while discussing
this, that the absence of Nora Ashwell was
first noticed. It was Dr. Leidenheim, after
a whispered exchange with his host, who
went quickly up to her bedroom, and getting
no answer to their summons, burst
open the locked door to find the room
empty. The bed had not been slept in; a
sofa had been dragged to the open window
where a rope of knotted sheets hung down
to the lawn below. The two brothers hurried
out of the house at once, joined after
a slight delay by Dr. Leidenheim who had
brought a couple of spades with him but
made no comment by way of explaining
why he did so. He handed one to the airman
without a word. Under the breaking
dawn of another brilliant day, the three men
followed the line of craters made by the
stick of bombs towards Goat Valley, as
they had surmised. Dr. Leidenheim led
them by the shortest way, having so often
visited the Silvanus temple ruins; and some
hundred yards further on the gray morning
light soon showed them what was left of
Nora Ashwell, blasted almost beyond recognition.
They found something else as
well, dead but hardly at all injured.</p>
<p>&quot;It should ‚Äî it <em>must</em> be buried,&quot; whispered
Dr. Leidenheim, and started to dig
a hole, signing to the airman to help him
with the second spade.</p>
<p>&quot;Burnt first, I think,&quot; said the surgeon.
And they all agreed. The airman, as he
collected wood and helped dig the hole,
felt slightly sick. The sun was up when
they reached the house, invaded the still
deserted kitchen and made coffee. There
was duties to be attended to presently, but
there was little talk, and the surgeon soon
retired to his study sofa for a nap.</p>
<p>&quot;Come to my room a moment, if you
will,&quot; Dr. Leidenheim proposed to the
young airman. &quot;There's something I'd like
to read to you; it would perhaps interest
you.&quot;</p>
<p>Up in the room he took a book from his
shelves. &quot;The travels and observations of
an old Greek,&quot; he explained, &quot;notes of
things he witnessed in his wanderings.
Pausanias, you know. I'll translate an incident
he mentions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'It is said that one of these beings
was brought to Sylla as that General returned
from Thessaly. The monster had
been surprised asleep in a cave. But his
voice was inarticulate. When brought
into the presence of Sylla, the Roman
General, he was so disgusted that he ordered
it to be instantly removed. The
monster answered in every degree to the
description which poets and painters
have given of it.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the airman. &quot;And ‚Äî er
‚Äî what was it supposed to be, this monster?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Satyr, of course,&quot; replied Dr. Leidenheim,
as he replaced the volume without
further comment except the muttered words,
&quot;One of the retinue of Pan.&quot;</p>
