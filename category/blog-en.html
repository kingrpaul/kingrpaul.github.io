<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>Dimble was not too proud to fight, but he was too old, too
stiff, too blind; he could not drill properly, because he really had
to think a moment before he knew which was his left and which
his right. There are some men who can positively do nothing; he
was one of them. With the best intentions in the world, burning,
zealous intentions too, he was yet useless. Unable to help, he
lost that comfort which comes the moment one's smaller burden is
merged in the collective burden of the nation. That peace being
denied him, his interest in the war on the other hand being intense,
he merely ‚Äî <em>read</em>. Morning, noon, and night, he read. He
read all the papers, but on Sunday he read only four, not counting
&quot;extras.&quot; Sunday was his day off.</p>
<p>He plunged with the ease of a bird from the heights of optimism
to the depths of pessimism. It wore him out. He believed
everything he read. Every move made on the great chess-board
was a clever trap into which either the enemy or the Allies would
march blind-eyed. He yearned to warn the latter. In time, however,
the &quot;trap&quot; idea collapsed; it never came off; the lure was
non-existent. A certain paper declared that the enemy would
never be caught without its glasses ‚Ä¶ he gave up buying it for
a week, then surreptitiously went back to it because it <em>proved</em> that
the Germans were using their last reserves. A bad communiqu√©
could keep him awake at night, so could a very good one.‚Ä¶</p>
<p>From the Eastern and Western fronts, at length, he switched
off upon the Balkans, till he became so entangled that he ‚Äî well,
though his walls were covered with maps, he never could remember
even whether Roumania was north of Bulgaria, or vice versa;
nor which country claimed Bucharest or Sofia as its capital. Invariably
he had to inspect his maps. Bucharest, since it began
with B, ought to belong to Bulgaria; sometimes, judging by the
telegrams, it did, sometimes, judging by the articles, it didn't.
The Balkans became a gigantic jig-saw puzzle, all corners and
curves and points and angles that would not fit. The coloured
flags pricked his fingers, the maps got stained, the strip of carpet
below them grew threadbare.</p>
<p>For a time he confined himself to picture-papers, till he read
that most of the scenes were made somewhere in Surrey, or taken
from manoeuvres of five years ago. He flung himself next upon
strategy and diagrams of positions, till the chintzes on his chairs
expressed surprise and peril, and the very blood in his strained
eye-balls mapped the empty air with danger. Reality faded from
the world. He himself &quot;advanced&quot; up the street or &quot;retired&quot;
to his bedroom. On the way to his bath he muttered left, right,
left, left, left ‚Äî halt, then had to &quot;retreat in perfect order&quot; for
his forgotten sponge and towel. He confined himself in the last
resort to &quot;official news.&quot;‚Ä¶</p>
<p>This called for grim restraint, but the truth was he was getting
a little frightened. His speech showed signs of trouble, and sounds
became audible in his head occasionally ‚Äî z ‚Ä¶ sz ‚Ä¶ scz ‚Ä¶ czs ‚Ä¶
and pmj or mjp ‚Ä¶ and the like. He became aware of showers of
them sprinkling almost visibly through the air ‚Äî in the darkness,
explosive, spitting sparks. They even pricked him. His tongue
and throat grew sore. And there were other symptoms that
alarmed him. The worst, perhaps, was the mute j. He had somehow
got full of them without knowing it, either swallowed them or
breathed them in, he knew not which; but in any case he was interiorly
somewhat crowded with soft heaps of these mute j's.
They were akin to microbes of a suppressed illness; for any
moment ‚Äî it was horrible to think of ‚Äî they might emerge, appear,
themselves, become not mute!</p>
<p>&quot;And what are <em>you</em> doing, Dimble?&quot; asked Spriggins at the
Club one day, good-naturedly. Spriggins, though bald and
crooked, wore &quot;G. R.&quot; and a big red armlet every Sunday on
route marches that nearly killed him. Dimble looked up helplessly
into his face. He answered. Speech of a kind, at least,
came twanging, buzzing from his lips:</p>
<p>&quot;Ceskz ‚Ä¶ kivitch ‚Ä¶ ski ‚Ä¶ kzs ‚Ä¶ z . z. z. jjjjjjj!&quot;
he replied. His voice cracked oddly; tiny explosions were audible
inside his chest; his throat held soda-water.</p>
<p>He did not notice how Spriggins got away; he &quot;retreated,&quot;
apparently in good order. It was certainly a rapid movement.
Spriggins was not surrounded, at all events. And he left Dimble
standing there as though he had been burned, destroyed, utterly
devastated till nothing of any value remained inside his outer
physical frame.</p>
<p>Matters had grown so serious by this time that he made a prodigious
effort, and renounced all papers whatsoever ‚Äî for an entire
day. For twenty-four hours he read no news, no expert articles,
no forecasts, no r√©sum√©s, no analyses of the Balkan soul, nor one
single report from a neutral traveller just returned from everywhere.
He did not even look at a line from an official or diplomatic
source whose authority it is impossible to doubt. He
moved no single pin upon his many maps. He lay in darkness ‚Äî
he also lay in bed. He starved. A strange hunger woke in him:
He knew an intolerable emptiness. He slept a little, however,
and murmured in his sleep ‚Äî for it was troubled ‚Äî &quot;Official news,
official news ‚Ä¶ csz .. ksz .. j.j.j.‚Ä¶!&quot;</p>
<p>Dimble recovered a bit and lived his life as best he could. He
was careful now, not to say cautious. He reconnoitred before
every single act; also he deployed. But things went rather quickly
after that. He slept by day in a darkened room, and went out
only in the night. He could not see the posters thus; the paper
man at the corner, who now cut him dead instead of smiling cheerfully,
could be avoided. This was the serious stage for Dimble.
By the candlelight in his bedroom he noticed curious marks upon
his arm; the skin seemed mottled. He said, &quot;Bites, by Nicholas!&quot;
and thought of queer, invisible insects. Yet the marks
apparently traced a pattern; they had design, meaning, almost
rhythm. They were horribly familiar. And then he knew ‚Äî they
were j's. The mute j's were coming out! &quot;Spies!&quot; he cried in
terror. &quot;I'm betrayed! I've harboured spies! All this time
they've been in my very midst! He knew he was done for then,
but he did not fully realise his ghastly position until, the following
night, he detected further marks. They were quite distinct.
He easily made them out in the dark. He saw &quot;Official ‚Ä¶&quot;</p>
<p>It was a dreadful business. He could not tell a soul, because
his communications were all cut. He faced the worst with courage;
no one should say he was a coward or a slacker. He ordered
<em>all</em> the papers again, and sat reading them by daylight in his
room. He went boldly to the Club and read them openly,
brazenly, with true defiance. He agreed with everything he read,
he understood it all, but he had no feelings now, he was neither
optimistic nor the reverse. He simply read. ‚Ä¶ It was odd, but
no one noticed him. In his room one day the landlady came in to
brush and sweep ‚Äî she ignored his presence, tidying the papers up
all round him as though he were not there at all. The same thing
happened at the Club. A waiter even tried to smooth him out
and hang him on the file, and once he was nearly ‚Äî oh, it was
wicked ‚Äî nearly picked up and offered to another member, Spriggins.
Only, luckily, Spriggins had the decency to refuse him.
He did it so nicely too: &quot;No, thanks,&quot; he said with a little
smile, &quot;I've read it. There's nothing in it, anyhow!&quot;</p>
<p>It was that very night when Dimble woke towards the early
hours, and heard a crackling as he turned in bed. Terror gripped
him. He lay quite still and listened. It was at the end of the
bed apparently ‚Äî a faint swishing, crackling noise with tiny reports
accompanying it. He moved his foot; the sound was repeated.
Something glimmered dimly. He moved the other foot, his arm
as well, he sat up briskly. There was a leaping rush of the vague
white form across the air; with a tap and slither it fell upon the
floor beside him. He stooped over to pick it up, and his hand
came into contact with something smooth and warm that was in
the act of settling upon the floor. He felt the little wind it made.
It was, of course, a newspaper. But the same instant, and before
he removed his hand, he knew by the warmth of it that it was
something more besides. It was not different from himself. What
in the world had happened to him? It <em>was</em> himself. His hand
was on the skin of his bare chest. He was crackling all over ‚Äî
but very nicely, very crisply. He settled back into bed with a kind
of rush and slither. His terror passed. He felt well pleased with
himself. &quot;It's all right,&quot; he murmured, as he fell asleep. &quot;For
a moment I thought I was a halfpenny one! I must be more careful.
Near shave, that! I must mention it to Spriggins ‚Ä¶ when
I'm out!&quot; There was an odd smell of printers' ink in the air.</p>
<p>Next morning he came out duly, and Spriggins bought him
for a penny, right enough, and took him in his pocket on a long
route march. While resting for lunch with his company, out by
the Welsh Harp, which is 'Endon Wy', he lit his pipe with him.
Dimble tried to utter a protest, but he stammered horribly. He
could not get his words at all. He made a fizzy, crackling noise
instead ‚Äî of which Spriggins, puffing the smoke at him, took no
slightest notice.</p>
<p>Then Dimble curled up, turned slowly black and passed away
into the wind and fell into a stubble-field near by, and lay there
quite happily until the dew that night came softly down and dissolved
him into nothing ‚Äî nothing visible or of value at any rate.
