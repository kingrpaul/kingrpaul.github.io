        <p>FLASH-RT was intended as a way to freeze the motion of radiotherapy patients who can never quite be still, like a flash-cube might freeze a subject in photography.         Interesting as this was, the real excitement comes from the serendipitous discovery that healthy tissues are resistant to radiation, when it arrives quickly, in a ‘flash’.</p>
        <p>A FLASH radiotherapy treatment would need to be very fast, requiring a radiation beam about 100 times more powerful than clinically available today.         But, given time, we humans are very good at making machines more powerful; and when biology identifies a need, technology has a <a class="" href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">tendency to meet it</a>.</p>
        <p>Because of its radio-biological advantage, when FLASH-RT becomes available to the clinic, it must quickly become the standard of care. Every facility in the country will be shopping for a new particle accelerator. Whoever brings this to market first will be selling them faster than they can make them. And, then Varian will introduce a knock-off.</p>
        <p>Electrical things tend to move faster than mechanical things and an accelerator can be electronically switched more quickly than it can be spun around on a rotating gantry. Fast electronic switching is central to the van-mobile FLASH-RT concept demonstrated by <a class="" href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/about/slac-overview">SLAC</a>, who hopes to achieve the necessary intensity.</p>
        <p>A set of lunch-box-sized mini-linacs mounted on a fixed-ring could be switched on and off quite quickly. This Stanford concept is called the <a class="" href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/01/researchers-aim-to-develop-radiation-therapy-with-short-exposure.html">PHASER</a> as the linacs would operate out of <a class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor">phase</a> with each other.</p>
        <p>More recently, SLAC <a class="" href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/02/accelerator-chip-research-fight-cancer/">announced</a> the creation of a tiny micro-linac “chip”, which is powered by red light instead of microwaves.</p>

        <p>Switching a toothpick-sized micro-linac should be faster still than switching a lunchbox-sized mini-linac. But also, a solid state accelerator, driven by a laser-diode, should produce much less heat. In the way that the solid-state transistor is more efficient and less expensive than a vacuum tube, which made computers more powerful, the micro-linac might play a crucial role in making medical accelerators more powerful.</p>
        <p>SLAC’s micro-linac can accelerate electrons to 1-keV, but researchers intend to achieve 1-MeV by the end of <a class="" href="http://stanford.io/35XudWC">2020</a>. This is nearly the energy of Cobalt-60. Perhaps the toothpick linac will become the basis for the clinical FLASH-RT technology that it seems clear is coming, whatever its form, in the not-too-distant future.</p>
        <p>While, it is unclear what has been the impact of clinical ultrasound becoming a cell-phone app available from <a class="" href="http://amzn.to/360KGJA">Amazon</a>, when the x-ray tube shrunk from <a class="" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Photographs-and-schematic-diagram-of-the-model-S700-Xoft-Axxent-X-Ray-Source-The-left_fig5_6646765">pounds to grams</a>, it replaced radioisotope brachytherapy. And, this was probably a good thing.</p>
        <p>Will there be an intracavitary linac?</p>
        <p>Maybe. But it seems unavoidable that, on the path from 1 keV to 1 MeV, will be a device that makes about 100 keV, a diagnostic energy. If it becomes possible to build a solid-state accelerator, operating at diagnostic energies, with a small focal spot; then the diagnostic x-ray tube becomes obsolete.</p>
        <p>The <a class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomotherapy">Tomotherapy</a>  concept was borrowed by radiotherapy from diagnostic radiology. Tomo is essentially a megavoltage CT, in which the dose is the goal and the image is a side-effect. It echoes the kilovoltage CT, in which the image is the goal and the dose is a side-effect.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, next time around the inspiration will go the other way, by extending Stanford’s non-rotating treatment concept to a fixed CT imaging device. Electronically switching, in a flash, among micro-sources, fixed around a gantry, interspersed among detectors, and arranged around a full circle could add a whole new dimension to available image data, making possible a much better image for much less dose.</p>
        <p>The future could bring interesting times – but, in a good way - for both imaging and treatment.</p>
