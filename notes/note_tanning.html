    <div class="container text-left">
      <p>Almost half of all cancers occur on the skin making the skin the most common site of cancer
        induction<sup>1</sup>. Ultraviolet light is the dominant cause of skin cancer<sup>2</sup> and this disease is
        projected to cause 11,000 deaths in 2009<sup>1</sup>. Tanning beds use electronic ultraviolet (<abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>) lamps as an artificial source of <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> light,
        which quickly tans the skin of the occupant. These devices were introduced in the U.S. by Friedrich Wolff in
        1978<sup>3</sup>. While early in this nation’s history, a fair complexion might signify wealth and the avoidance
        of outdoor, tan-producing, agrarian labor; today, it more generally implies leisure and is typically associated
        with the perception of wealth, health, and physical attractiveness<sup>4</sup>. So naturally, the tanning bed
        business has grown into a $5B a year industry<sup>4</sup> with 25,000 tanning salons operating in the
        U.S.<sup>5</sup>. In many cities, these near-ubiquitous tanning salons outnumber both Starbucks and
        McDonalds<sup>6</sup>. On average, over a million Americans per day<sup>6</sup>, or over 30 million each
        year<sup>4</sup>, use a tanning bed to darken their skin. The nation’s rate of skin cancer has paralleled this
        growth in the use of tanning beds, particularly among people who begin before age 30<sup>7</sup>. The national
        incidence of invasive melanoma has more than doubled since tanning beds were introduced in 1978<sup>8</sup>.
        Tanning beds are primarily used by girls and young women<sup>9</sup>, with nearly 70% of tanning bed users being
        female and between the ages of 16 and 29<sup>6</sup>. One tanning bed user in 13 is an adolescent<sup>10</sup>
        with nearly 40% of teenage girls reporting use of a tanning bed within the last year<sup>1</sup>.</p>
      <p>The <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> spectrum produced by tanning beds includes both a more-penetrating
        <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B component and a less-penetrating <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>A
        component. In addition to being carcinogenic, both <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>A and <abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B are immunosuppressive<sup>11</sup> and exposure to ten tanning sessions in two
        weeks is known to produce immune suppression<sup>10</sup>. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>) advises that those with certain medical conditions, such as
        lupus, diabetes, and susceptibility to cold sores; avoid using tanning beds<sup>9</sup>. The American Cancer
        Society (ACS), more generally, considers the use of tanning beds to be a health hazard and recommends that they
        be avoided altogether<sup>9</sup>. In July, the World Health Organization’s (<abbr
          title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>’s) International Agency for Research on Cancer (<abbr
          title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</abbr>) completed a study of tanning beds and
        re-designated these devices from “probably carcinogenic to humans” into its highest risk category, designating
        it definitely “carcinogenic to humans”<sup>9</sup>. <abbr
          title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</abbr> found that the risk of melanoma on the skin,
        the most lethal form of skin cancer, rises 75% when use of tanning beds begins before age 30 and also finds
        evidence of a link between tanning bed use and the incidence of ocular melanoma<sup>9</sup>.</p>
      <p>Though many manufacturers are now increasing the more-penetrating <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B
        component of their tanning beams, to speed up the tanning process<sup>10</sup>, <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> regulation does specify a minimal beam-quality performance
        standard, which places some restraint on the proportion of the tanning light that is permitted to be in the
        more-penetrating <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B part of the spectrum<sup>12</sup>. There is a false, but
        widespread, perception that <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>A is “good <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>”
        while <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B is “bad <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>”<sup>6</sup>. And, it is
        important to recognize that <abbr title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</abbr>’s designation
        of <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> radiation as “carcinogenic to humans” applies to the full ultraviolet
        spectrum; the less-penetrating <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>A, the more-penetrating <abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>B, as well as the most-penetrating <abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>C<sup>9</sup>. It is also notable that, though <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> regulation requires a manufacturer to specify the <abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> lamp model for which the tanning bed was designed<sup>12</sup>, it does not
        prevent substitutions and salon operators often tamper with these lamps to achieve a more intense ultraviolet
        exposure<sup>4</sup>.</p>
      <p>Also, though the manufacturer must post warning labels on the tanning bed<sup>12</sup>, many tanning salon
        operators misrepresent the health risks, openly advertising that tanning beds do not cause cancer<sup>4</sup>
        and the industry generally claims that the use of these devices is healthy<sup>13</sup>. Tanning beds are often
        advertised as a safe alternative to exposure to the sun<sup>10, 14</sup>. A German study of
        indoor-tanners<sup>15</sup> found a widespread public perception that artificial tanning is safe or even healthy
        and a widespread, though mistaken, public perception that tanning bed use “prepares” the skin in a protective
        way for exposure to the sun. It is common practice, for example, among U.S. college students to use tanning
        lights to create a “base” tan, in anticipation of further near-term solar exposure<sup>16</sup>. A minimum
        erythema dose (<abbr title="minimum erythema dose">MED</abbr>) is the amount of <abbr
          title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> light required to redden exposed skin and, though the <abbr
          title="minimum erythema dose">MED</abbr> varies with skin type, a twenty minute tanning bed exposure typically
        delivers quadruple the minimum erythema dose<sup>10</sup>. An eight-to-twenty minute tanning session often
        delivers a more intense <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> exposure than an entire afternoon spent in natural
        sunlight<sup>10</sup>.</p>
      <p>Use of a tanning bed is a pleasant experience, producing a sense of relaxation and well being, and research
        suggests that the use of tanning beds leads the body to produce natural opioids and endorphins<sup>13</sup>.
        But, there is also significant evidence that tanning bed use can be addictive, and discontinuing the use of
        tanning beds has been observed to produce the withdrawal symptoms of jitteriness and nausea<sup>13</sup>.
        Excessive sun tanning has been identified and studied as a substance-related psychological
        disorder<sup>17</sup>. Exploiting this, most tanning salons in the U.S. use buffet-style unlimited price
        packaging<sup>6</sup> which encourages the frequent and extended use of tanning beds. This positive
        reinforcement was substantiated by Borner, et al (2009), who found that those who use tanning beds frequently,
        more than ten times per year; also use them for long durations, greater than fifteen minutes per session.</p>
      <p>The first priority of <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, in response to the findings of <abbr
          title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</abbr>, is to reduce the use of tanning beds by
        persons under age 18<sup>9</sup> and in France, where <abbr
          title="International Agency for Research on Cancer">IARC</abbr> is located, those under age 18 are already
        prohibited from using tanning beds<sup>11</sup>. Germany is considering, but has not yet enacted age
        restrictions on the use of tanning beds<sup>15</sup>. In September, Wales banned the use of tanning beds by
        minors and there is interest in extending this ban to England<sup>18</sup>. Unmanned, coin-operated tanning
        booths have made the Welsh law difficult to enforce and coin-operated booths have already been outlawed in
        Scotland<sup>18</sup>. Unconstrained by law, U.S. tanning bed operators have been found to make these beds
        available to tanners at any age and without restraint<sup>19</sup>. </p>
      <p>A study in the Denver area, in fact, concluded that the use of <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> tanning-beds
        was commonly and specifically marketed to adolescents through high school newspaper advertisments and the
        study’s authors recommended that public health policies prohibit the targeting of minors by tanning booth
        operators<sup>20</sup>. Legal research has found broad similarities in business-model between the indoor tanning
        industry and the cigarette industry. Both are described as selling an “unreasonably dangerous” carcinogen and in
        each case it is asserted that the industry systematically lied to its consumers about the health effects
        associated with an image-motivated, acquired-behavior<sup>4</sup>. There is, at present, no national policy
        restricting the use of tanning beds by minors in the United States<sup>19</sup>.</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine states, however, do regulate the use of tanning beds by minors<sup>21</sup> and in 2009, 22 states
        have introduced<sup>22</sup> and four states have passed<sup>21</sup> new legislation or legislative amendments
        restricting indoor tanning by minors. Existing and proposed restrictions vary widely, setting limits at the ages
        of 18, 16, 16½, 15, 14, and 13. In some cases, these laws ban the use of tanning beds outright or ban them
        without a physician’s prescription, which sometimes must specify a diagnosis or the number of tanning sessions.
        Some policies require written parental consent, which must sometimes be given in the presence of the operator.
        In some cases, this consent must specify the tanning frequency, require positive identification, or even require
        a notarized signature. In one case, the tanner must quantify her (or his) skin-type in terms of its sensitivity
        to the sun. In some cases, a parent must be present, during the first visit or during all visits. And, in some
        states, the parent must certify an acknowledgement of the risks or guarantee that the child will use eye
        protection<sup>22</sup>. </p>
      <p>A pending Texas bill would require that any minor under 18 be both accompanied by a parent and have physician
        approval<sup>6</sup>, though that state’s law now permits unrestricted use of tanning beds by anyone over age 16
        ½<sup>1</sup>. Both New York, which has among the fewest tanning salons per capita, and Charleston, WV, which
        has the most tanning salons per capita<sup>6</sup>, ban the use of tanning beds before age 14 and each requires
        parental consent until the age of 18<sup>22</sup>. At the county level, efforts are underway in Howard County,
        Maryland and Suffolk County, New York to ban the use of tanning beds by persons under age 18<sup>1</sup>. In
        addition to these 29 states, four counties also currently regulate the use of tanning beds by
        minors<sup>1</sup>. </p>
      <p>At the U.S. federal level, tanning beds are jointly regulated by the <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>, which enforces manufacturing and labeling standards, and by
        the Federal Trade Commission (<abbr title="Federal Trade Commission">FTC</abbr>), which seeks to protect
        consumers against fraud and unfair business practices, including false claims<sup>14</sup>. <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> regulations require that tanning beds be labeled
        ``<strong>DANGER</strong> -- Ultraviolet radiation” and carry warnings about the potential for eye injury, skin
        injury, allergic reaction, premature skin aging, skin cancer, and the increased sensitivity created by some
        cosmetics and medications<sup>12</sup> which includes common medications such as antihistamines and oral
        contraceptives<sup>14</sup>. This labeling must also include exposure factors that the manufacturer recommends
        for use in tanning<sup>12</sup>, but does not constrain what those recommendations should be. These warning
        requirements were established in 1985, just seven years after tanning beds were introduced and long before the
        national incidence of skin cancer had reached its present level. Though an <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> agency review of these warnings began in 2007<sup>9</sup>,
        these requirements have now been in place for a full 24 years. Though <abbr
          title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> regulations do place some limits on the tanning beam’s
        spectrum, require that a tanning bed be delivered with protective eyewear and a timer, and require that the
        protective eyewear meet a certain attenuation standard; these regulations place no limit on the intensity of the
        beam, as it reaches either the skin or the eye<sup>12</sup>.</p>
      <p>In terms of public health, a lighted tanning bed resembles nothing so much as a lit cigarette; with a
        profitable and well-lobbied industry that dishonestly sells a false image of health and vitality, while
        targeting a known carcinogen to young American girls, which is delivered through addictive behavior. An
        international call has been made to protect the public from radiogenic skin cancer by protecting children from
        ultraviolet tanning booths. The European nations are rapidly answering that call. In this country, many states,
        and even some counties, are attempting to respond to this threat to the public’s health by restricting the
        access of minors to tanning booths. Though these responses have been slow, complicated, fragmented, and
        inconsistent; a consensus has clearly developed in these regional incubators of national policy. No tanning
        booth operator, anywhere in the nation, should be permitted to <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>-irradiate
        children for money any more than any convenience store operator, anywhere in the nation, should be permitted to
        sell children cigarettes.</p>
      <p>A small, but key, step forward in the protection of children from <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> tanning
        beds would be to amend Title XIX of the Social Security Act to require that each state, as a condition of
        receiving Medicaid federal matching funds, specify in legislation by 2011, some minimum age limit on the use of
        commercially operated <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr>-lamp-based tanning devices and that this age must be
        no less than 13. First and foremost, this would mandate the creation of some age restriction for the protection
        of girls in the 21 states where no such protections now exist. It would also catalyze a re-evaluation and
        tightening of the policies in those states which already have restrictions. Leaving the policy details to the
        states creates federal leadership and coordination while also showing deference to state sovereignty and a
        respect for the traditional role of state governments in public health. Linking this policy change to the
        Medicaid program makes it a joint-venture, undertaken in cooperation between the federal and state governments,
        intended to protect children, improve the health of the public, and reduce the cost of healthcare to society by
        reducing the incidence of this very preventable disease.</p>
