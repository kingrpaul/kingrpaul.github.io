<p>Regulations require that a prescription include a dose, its fractionation,
and a site which is the destination for that dose. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>When scaling a RayStation plan’s dose (sometimes called “normalizing”), the
total treatment time is multiplied by a constant, so that the absolute dose
is either increased or decreased, while the relative dose distribution remains
unchanged. Dose scaling is a normal step in RayStation planning, necessary to
make a plan conform to the prescription.</p>
<p>The details of a plan’s scaling are more specific than is required for a
prescription, so that a single dose prescription might rightly be described
by a number of different dose scalings. RayStation is flexible in its ability
to scale a plan to deliver any prescribed dose. And, the dose part of the dose
prescription can itself be scaled by a percentage. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>A specific prescription is one component of a RayStation plan and, in general,
the desired normalization is entered as a prescription and the plan is then
normalized to that prescription. But, RayStation does not require this and can
scale a plan to some other set of criteria that is not the prescription.
RayStation does not enforce the requirement that a plan fulfill its associated
prescription. In general, however, scaling to the prescription is the right
approach and other dose scalings are to be avoided.</p>
<p>A plan dose can be scaled either to a dose-volume pair in a target’s dose-volume
histogram (DVH), or to some geometric point in the dataset. There are three types
of points used by RayStation and two of them can be used for dose scaling.</p>
<p>The three types of RayStation points are:
(1) points of interest (POI) defined in the patient model,
(2) dose specification points (DSP) defined in beam descriptions and
(3) isocenters (ISO) defined as part of the plan.
A plan’s dose can be scaled and prescribed to a POI or to a DSP,
but not to an ISO.</p>
<p>In general, in an x-ray plan, there will be one ISO and one DSP,
and these will be at the same location. There will also be a POI of type
“isocenter” at that same location. RayStation allows multiple ISOs in a plan
but, in general, only one should be used. There is one DSP per beam but the
number of POIs is not limited.</p>
<p>For x-ray planning, there will generally be two POIs: one of type “localization”
and another of type “isocenter”. There will be one ISO at the same coordinates as
the isocenter-type POI and one DSP at the same coordinates as the ISO. But, because
RayStation is flexible, this is not enforced. It is easy for these points to become
disconnected during planning and their coincidence must be checked.
Confining complexity is imporant to RayStation planning.</p>
<p>Where practical and appropriate, dose should be scaled to the isocenter POI, which
will be an appropriate ICRU reference point <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a>;
i.e. one that is relevant, representative, unambiguous, physically accurate,
and clear of steep gradients. It is frequenty appropriate to specify the prescription
in terms of a percentage of isocenter dose.</p>
<p>For Clinac planning, the localization POI will be labeled  “SETUP” and the isocenter
POI will be labeled “ISO”. For Tomotherapy planning, the localization POI will be labeled
“RED LASER” and the isocenter POI will be labeled “GREEN LASER”. In both bases, the
localization POI will be red and the isocenter POI will be green.</p>
<p>Scaling dose using a dose-volume pair presents the problem of how to distill a dose
distribution down to a single dose value. This is a problem which does not have a
unique solution.
In Appendix III, ICRU 50 considered the relative merits of using a central point dose,
versus minimum dose, versus mean dose.</p>
<p>When the variation in target dose is small, i.e. within +5%, the most meaningful
distillation of a target’s dose distribution is the mean dose. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a>
When dose variations are not small the minimum dose becomes the more appropriate value.
As a result, quoting Brahme, “uniform and precise dose delivery is therefore one of the
cornerstones of accurate radiation therapy”.</p>
<p>Any consideration of a dose distribution’s quality should respect the inherent value of
dose uniformity in the target. A dose distribution with an “ideal” target dose uniformity
would have an integral DVH described by the step function as
V<sub>integral</sub> = -H(D - D<sub>prescribed</sub>)
and a differential DVH described by the delta function as
V<sub>differential</sub>= δ(D - D<sub>prescribed</sub>).
But, nature abhors a right angle and no DVH is ever ideal. Still, target dose homogeneity
should not be sacrificed except in exchange for some demonstrably significant benefit.</p>
<p>It is always possible to optimize a target’s DVH by overcovering the target,
i.e. by using an excessive planning margin. This is a bad idea.
There were occasions, before availability of IMRT, and before Tomotherapy,
when it might make sense to compromise on target dose homogeneity to achieve critical
structure sparing – particularly when using sub-optimal beams.</p>
<p>Where the variation in target dose is large, ICRU-50 calls for both the dose and its
variation to be reported. But using modern tools and methods, target dose homogeneity
and critical structure sparing are no longer truly in competition.</p>
<p>One goal of planning should be for the target’s equivalent dose to be captured by its
mean dose, not by it’s minimum dose. If the target’s dose variation is large, the target
dose is described by its minimum dose, and the hot spots inside the target are by necessity
produced at the expense of increased non-target integral dose, and to the detriment of the
plan’s quality. The mean dose should also ideally be the dose at the ICRU reference point.
All doses inside the target should be within +5% of that dose, so that “dose” and “mean dose”
mean the same thing.</p>
<p>RayStation does not support a prescribing to mean dose, but it does support prescribing to
median dose. So long as the differential DVH is not skewed, the mean and median doses will be
equal. So, median dose serves as a proxy for the mean and it is the median dose that should
be used, in general, when scaling and prescribing to a DVH.</p>
<p>In an integral DVH that is optimal, 50% of the volume will be covered by the prescribed dose,
100% of the volume will be covered by 95% of the prescribed dose and none of the volume will
exceed 105% of the prescribed dose. This DVH will have the characteristic rounded shoulder
and toe that result from integrating a gaussian.</p>
<p>Where different regions are intended to receive different doses, these should be segmented as
different structures. It has become a common practice, where it is appropriate for a single plan
to simultaneously deliver different doses to different volumes at the same time, to delineate
those targets from each other and to incorporate the intended dose into those target names. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f5" id="id5">[5]</a>
This is a good practice that enhances the treatment planning process by fully describing the
goals of planning at the outset. Where different doses are intended, different sites should be specified.</p>
<p>Where one volume, that is to receive a lower dose, abuts or encompasses another volume that is to
receive a higher dose, the lower-dose volume is treated as a special case. Consider for example an
outer volume that is to receive 4000 cGy surrounding an inner volume that is to receive 5000 cGy.
The high-dose volume will be held to the usual 5% limits (4750 to 5250 cGy).
The low-dose volume would be held to it’s usual lower limit of 3800 cGy. But instead of restricting
it’s upper limit to 4200 cGy, it would instead be held to 5000 cGy.</p>
