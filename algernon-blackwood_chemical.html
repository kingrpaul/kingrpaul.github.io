<!-- BODY_START -->
<p>It is odd how trivial a thing can cause a first, instinctive dislike:
the way a man wears his hat, the smirk with which
a woman uses her mirror and lipstick in a public place ‚Äî
and the aversion is suddenly aroused. Later knowledge may
justify this first dislike, but the actual start has been the
merest triviality.</p>
<p>Some think, however, this cause has not been so trivial
as it appears; that gesture, being an unconscious expression
of the entire personality, may betray far more than speech,
which is calculated. Moleson, thinking over the brusqueness
of the stranger on the doorstep, the unnecessary way he
pushed ahead of him and up the stairs, his whole air, indeed,
of general resentment and disapproval, found himself
recalling a rather significant answer that a very wise old
man had once given in his hearing to a commonplace question.
The question was not his own: he was listening to
two friends discussing a third.</p>
<p>'Everything indicates,' said the first, carelessly enough,
'that I ought to like X. I have nothing against him. Quite the
reverse, in fact. Yet I do not like him. I simply cannot like
him, try as I will. Now ‚Äî why don't I?'</p>
<p>'Your dislike,' was the reply, 'is probably chemical.
Merely chemical.'</p>
<p>This came back to Moleson's mind now, as he unpacked his
things and arranged himself in the top-floor bed-sitting room
he had engaged that afternoon. It was in Bloomsbury, close
to the British Museum. The November twilight was setting
in; the gas, electric light stopping at the second floor, was
poor; his reading lamp was not yet unpacked. 'Chemical!
‚Ä¶ ' he thought. 'I wonder! ‚Ä¶ ' as he looked out a moment
into the rather dismal street, where the Museum buildings
blocked the sky with their sombre and formidable mass.
He had, of course, the layman's vague knowledge of the
loves and hates of atoms, their intense attraction and repulsion
for each other, the dizzy rapidity with which they
rushed towards, or away from, those they respectively liked
or disliked. Had all the atoms of which he was composed,
then, turned their backs instinctively upon those which
made up the stranger's body, racing away at a headlong
speed that caused him this acute and positive discomfort?
Was his instantaneous loathing 'chemical merely? ‚Ä¶ '</p>
<p>As he bustled about arranging his things, his dislike of the
fellow remained vivid and persistent. The recent scene again
passed through his mind in detail.</p>
<p>He had called in the morning and interviewed Mrs Smith,
with the result: 'Not at the moment, sir, I 'aven't got a
room free'; then, after a rather curious hesitation, 'But later
a little, maybe'; then more hesitation; 'This afternoon,
per'aps ‚Äî I ‚Äî I might be able to manage it ‚Äî if you could make
it convenient ‚Äî to call in again ‚Ä¶ '; whereupon, seeing that
the house was so admirably close to the Reading Room
where his daily work would be, Moleson offered to pay in
advance, but was then quick enough to see that it was not
the question of money alone that troubled the woman. Her
hesitation, he perceived, was not mere independence, nor
was it due to his unprosperous appearance. She wanted a
lodger, clearly enough ‚Äî if she could 'manage it', whatever
that might mean ‚Äî and it was not himself that she objected
to. It was, he felt sure, a calculation of sorts she was trying
to make in her own mind. He wisely decided to give her
time to make it.</p>
<p>'I'll look in again,' he said, 'about three o'clock, say,' and
he added, with his pleasant smile, that most of his time
would be spent working in the Museum opposite.</p>
<p>It was on his return in the afternoon that the scene
occurred.</p>
<p>He had rung the bell, and was waiting just inside the
narrow hall while the maid hurried downstairs to fetch Mrs
Smith, the street door still ajar behind him, when somebody,
another lodger evidently, pushed past brusquely,
offensively, almost resentfully, half shoving him, yet without
actual contact, from where he stood at the foot of the
Stairs ‚Äî slightly in the way, perhaps ‚Äî and without so much
as By your Leave. There might, of course, have been a grunt
of apology, for Moleson was a little deaf, but the man's
attitude made it unlikely, and the pose of the head and
shoulders, the face being turned away and not visible, was
far more of resentful disapproval than of apology. Moleson,
on the instant, loathed him, not because of the rudeness, but
because of some presentment his appearance offered that
stirred an intense, instinctive dislike amounting to positive
repulsion. A moment later, when Mrs Smith arrived, panting
and labouring, the man was up the stairs and out of
sight, but at first the impression left was so vivid that Moleson
would not have been altogether displeased if he had
heard that no room was, after all, available. The contrary,
however, took place. A bargain was struck, money passed
hands, and the room was his.</p>
<p>The majority of young men in these circumstances would
probably have given their attention to the landlady, to
whom money must be paid, and on whose goodwill they
must depend for their comfort and the like. Moleson, instead,
found himself thinking only of this rude fellow-lodger.
Over his dinner in a neighbouring restaurant he reflected
that his sudden dislike was odd; he had never set
eyes upon the fellow before, and as yet had not even seen
the face nor heard the voice, yet this loathing had leaped
into being. Revulsion, he called it. Its oddness, of course,
lay in this want of proportion. He gave a passing thought,
too, to his landlady, yet chiefly using her as a means of comparison
with the other. Her rather sombre visage, an overwhelming
melancholy in it, though certainly not attractive,
woke nothing stronger in him than a vague, tolerant sympathy.
He felt no dislike, at any rate; she merely didn't
matter; a worthy soul, he decided, worn into sadness by life.
Whereas the other human being gave him this instinctive,
deep revulsion. Chemical? He wondered. For why, if chemical,
should one unpleasing soul awake pity, and another,
equally unpleasing, stir violent antipathy? ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Over his coffee, he dismissed the little puzzle. His room
was admirably close to the Museum; Bloomsbury liked him;
and it was the number in the street ‚Äî Number eleven ‚Äî his
Manchester friend and employer had mentioned. The price,
too, suited him, for money was scarce, otherwise he would
not be 'devilling' for another man ‚Äî looking up certain
seventeenth-century facts for a writer who would probably
clear one thousand pounds over his silly book, yet 'must be
sure of my dates and facts, you know. Your expenses and
five pounds a week, if you'll do it for me. ‚Ä¶' The street
and number, close to the Museum, were added. Young Moleson,
ignorant of London, jumped at it.</p>
<p>It was some years before our Great Date this happened.
Jim Moleson, engaged to a sweet girl, and now married to
her, told me the details recently. The War intervened, of
course. He had learnt something. At that time I should have
described him as highly strung, sensitive at any rate, imaginative
certainly, poetic probably. I, his senior by a quarter
of a century, rather believed he wrote 'Celtic' poetry in his
bedroom. The War undeceived us about that type, revealed
them rather: their amazing courage, the splendour of their
'imagination', translated into reckless, inspired action. Jim,
anyhow, was always headstrong, fierce-tempered, 'nasty'
once his feelings were stirred, only these feelings were
usually for others ‚Äî for a lame dog, an injured cat, a bird in
a cage, an overworked horse. Slights, even insults to himself
he could stand, to the point of cowardice, some thought; but
this was wrong; he was easy-going to that point; beyond it
he saw red and ‚Äî killed. This savage temper, rarely roused,
and then with a curious suddenness, was an item I overlooked.
But it was a human, not merely an animal, temper.</p>
<p>His work at the Museum, apparently, absorbed him; no
more painstaking and accurate 'devil' ever devilled; and he
got back to his room, tired mentally and physically. A nice-looking,
upstanding lad with his mop of dark hair and blue
eyes, he soon made a friend of Mrs Smith ‚Äî over his letters
first: 'Lef' at Number seven,' she informed him, the printed
name of his employer's Institute on the envelope catching
her trained, if mournful, eye perhaps. The postman arst
me, and I thought they was for you,' she explained. So his
slight deafness had again betrayed him, and his employer
had said 'Number seven', instead of 'Number eleven'. They
talked on a bit. He had the feeling she wanted to talk a bit,
but wanted to talk about something in particular, and to
him. He explained about the letters and his troublesome
deafness in one ear; he heard her say 'your glass of porter'
when she actually said, 'hot bath water', and then, after a
nice little chat about the weather, prices, and ''ow times
was changing', he noticed that she suddenly stuck.</p>
<p>This was after a week in the house, he told me. The
appalling melancholy of her face came over him, but rather
in a new way; he realized it in some personal sense, I think,
as they stood awkwardly staring at one another, each waiting
for the other to speak, so that through his sensitive,
imaginative mind ran the thought: 'That's no ordinary sadness,
I'll be bound! ‚Ä¶ ' ‚Äî and then <em>he</em> stuck.</p>
<p>The impulse to say something kind rose in him, only he
could think of nothing to say, nothing suitable. It was here
he got his first clear, instinctive impression about this commonplace
woman: that she was interested, namely, to ask
some definite question of him, that, liking and trusting him,
and, further, having watched carefully and waited anxiously
the whole week, she now longed to put this definite query
to him, yet was afraid. The same hesitation he had seen first
on the doorstep showed itself in her face and sorrowful
eyes.</p>
<p>He had been vaguely aware of this for some time evidently,
but had not recognized it. It was not, he felt sure,
any question about his comfort, for he was old enough to
know that landladies rarely took that risk. Something, none
the less, she wanted to know, something personal to himself.
The suffering in her face made him wonder. A queer
sympathy moved through him. He recalled the stationer
round the corner in Bury Street, when he bought his paper
and materials: 'Oh yes, I know, sir; that's Mrs Warley's,'
saying he would send the parcel round, and, being corrected:
'No, Mrs Smith's,' he looked blank a moment, troubled a
little, but in a kindly sense, before he agreed : 'Oh yes, to be
sure, sir ‚Äî Mrs Smith's ‚Äî now. So it is. ‚Ä¶' That 'now' was
suggestive. She had changed her name, married again, no
doubt, yet there had been trouble of some sort, Moleson
gathered. And, though he had not pursued the matter at
the time, this little memory came back now, as he stood
chatting with her, trying to think of something pleasant he
might say. He wondered ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>'I'm very comfortable,' he said on impulse, presently.
'The room's just what I wanted ‚Äî' and he was about to add
some kind and soothing word when she interrupted in an
eager way that startled him:</p>
<p>'Oh, then everything is all right, sir? There's nothing, I
mean, interfering with your quiet? If anything annoys' -
she changed the verb, before it was completed, to 'disturbs',
then stopped dead.</p>
<p>It was not the words ‚Äî commonplace enough: it was her
face that startled him. It had been on the tip of her tongue,
he felt, to say 'anyone' instead of 'anything'. He knew it in
his bones. Also, she could have cut off that tongue for having
let it say what it <em>had</em> said. That, too, he perceived. This question
she longed yet feared to ask had nearly slipped out in
spite of herself. Her face, anyhow, betrayed an emotion that
for an instant obliterated its usual sadness. It was the emotion
of terror.</p>
<p>Moleson, as he caught it, felt shocked. The sharp instinct
came suddenly to him that it was wiser not to ask. He cut
the talk short, as nicely as he could. 'Nothing, nothing,' he
replied, gave her his pleasant smile, and went up quickly to
his room.</p>
<p>Her question was an approach to the real one she wanted
so much to ask. That, of course, he realized. Terror lay in
it; it was wrapped round with terror as in a cocoon. Once
the cocoon burst, was broken, out would come all the
hideous wriggling things that lay concealed inside. This was
the feeling Moleson carried upstairs with him. It was as
though he had just caught a glimpse, behind her suddenly
pale skin, of the hideous wriggling things that caused her
sadness and her terror, But another certainty lay in him too
at this moment: the question she had asked, this preliminary
question that was an approach to another, referred ‚Äî he
felt positive of it ‚Äî to someone he particularly sought to
keep out of his thoughts as much as ever he could. She referred,
indirectly thus, to the other lodger.</p>
<p>It was his habit at night, after his dinner round the corner,
to sort out the Notes of his day's work before an early
bed. Tonight, however, this talk stayed by him and prevented.
He sat thinking about it ‚Ä¶ and eventually, it seems,
thought circling and circling but coming to no satisfactory
conclusion of course, he dropped asleep, to wake very suddenly
much later in a state of uncommon distress ‚Äî 'acute
distress,' he called it, 'funk'.</p>
<p>This, I think, is one of the most curious and betraying
things about the whole business: that, even when he told
it all to me later, he kept off that unpleasant lodger, as he
called him ‚Äî kept him so long in the background. He had
begun by emphasizing his unusual repulsion towards the
fellow, dwelling upon it, stressing it, just as I have done in
this written account. But then, when I was expecting the
lodger to appear in some dreadful and dramatic guise ‚Äî a
sneak-thief, a forger with coining apparatus, a blackmailer
in league with Mrs Warley-Smith (as I styled her), even a
murderer hiding from the police with the woman's help ‚Äî
Moleson merely left him out. He ignored him, made no
mention of him. He talked about his work, about Mrs Smith,
his liking the house, yet disliking the room ‚Äî feeling it disliked
him and wanted him out ‚Äî about anything except
the sinister lodger. Having first firmly fixed him in my mind
as an ominous character, he just left him there. Thus, when
I tried to bring him to the point ‚Äî this suggestive point of
the sinister lodger, and a point he had himself established
in opening his tale ‚Äî he stopped abruptly, and stared into my
face, his features working, his eyes gone positively googly.
Some fear, I saw, still operated in him, unreleased. His face
gave me a touch of goose flesh. There was an ingredient of
salutary 'confession' in his delayed account, I began to
gather. He lowered his voice. 'I knew you'd ask that before
long,' he said. 'You see ‚Äî I shirked him myself.'</p>
<p>'Refused to acknowledge him, you mean?' I queried
vaguely. 'Tried to pretend he wasn't in the house?'</p>
<p>He nodded, looking down at his boots.</p>
<p>'You disliked him,' I insisted, 'to <em>that</em> point?' The expression
in his eyes, as he glanced up quickly, answered me
better than his words.</p>
<p>'It's unbelievable,' he whispered, 'how that fellow obsessed
me. Obsessed is the term.'</p>
<p>I asked if he saw him often.</p>
<p>'After that first encounter on the front-door steps ‚Äî only
twice, all told.'</p>
<p>The intensity, a sort of inner secrecy in him still, made me
hesitate, but as he said nothing, I presently asked boldly:</p>
<p>'But ‚Äî in the end ‚Äî you found out who he was, what he
was doing there? In a word ‚Äî why you loathed him so?' I
got no straight answer, but I got the full story, told in his
own evasive, curious way.</p>
<p>'I mentioned how I dropped asleep in my chair, and woke
up suddenly feeling frightened,' he went on. 'Well ‚Äî that's
the point, you see.'</p>
<p>'What is?' I asked, justifiably dense.</p>
<p>He cast his eyes down as though he were ashamed of it.
'I'd been frightened all along,' he muttered. 'Damned
frightened. Ever since I'd been in that awful house, I'd been
frightened.'</p>
<p>'Of ‚Äî him?'</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>He believed he had discovered why the fellow resented
his being there: it was because Moleson occupied his room.
Mrs Smith had hesitated that first morning whether she could
turn him out or not ‚Äî his rent probably overdue, and what
not ‚Äî but eventually had spoken to him ‚Äî and Moleson, as
described, cash in hand, had moved in. It was a sufficiently
obvious explanation.</p>
<p>'But that didn't explain my own abhorrence ‚Äî did it?'</p>
<p>Obviously not.</p>
<p>'He may have felt resentful, furious, because I'd got his
room, but that couldn't have made me feel the physical repulsion,
to the point of nausea, which I did feel. And dread
too. I only saw him twice after that first meeting, but
though I saw him so rarely, I knew he was in the house
with me. I never forgot it. He was all over the house expresses
it better. I was always expecting to meet him, to run
across him on the stairs, to find him in the hall. When I
came down the street I imagined him standing on the doorstep,
fumbling with his latchkey. When I went to my bath
halfway down the stairs, I thought we should pass. At night,
if I went out to post a letter; in the morning when I opened
my door to take my hot water in. But, no; he: made no sign,
I did not meet him. What he did all day I have no notion:
he never went out, so far as I saw or knew. But then I myself
was out from nine to five, then again for my dinner
between eight and nine, you see.'</p>
<p>At a great rate he rattled this off. He gave me a good deal
in a very few words.</p>
<p>A definite question halted his rambling account, though
it was my object, otherwise, to hear the tale just as he cared
to tell it.</p>
<p>'Describe him?' He repeated my words. 'As I first saw
him ‚Äî? Oh yes. Though I didn't see the features, remember,
that time.' Then he startled me by raising his voice
most unexpectedly in his excitement: 'Misshapen!' he
shouted in my face, so that I jumped. 'Well, you asked me;
and that's what I felt about him. But mentally, morally,
rather than physically. That's the impression he made on
me.' And then he barked out another word: 'A monster!'
A little shudder ran over him. 'I didn't see the face,' he went
on, 'because he didn't mean me to see it. He moved sideways,
the shoulder next to me humped up a trifle so as to
hide it. A bit of a beard I saw, or whiskers, straggly hair,
anyhow, that left in my mind some faint notion of pretence,
of a wig perhaps. But my mind at the moment was
on my business with Mrs Smith, and I wasn't trying to see
what a stranger pushing rudely past me was like. I had no
particular interest in him then. Clothes? ‚Ä¶ Oh, that I
couldn't say with accuracy either, but a dark suit, and a
bowler hat on his head. <em>Dark</em>,' he emphasized, 'the whole
look and feel of the man was dark.'</p>
<p>I was still anxiously waiting for that account of his waking
up frightened in his chair, for my interest was now
deeply held. But I was patient; I had to be. He went on to
tell me how he was for ever expecting to see the man again,
yet did not see him. This repetition, in the tale as he told it,
was not redundant, though, when written, it may seem so.
It led up with a bang, as it were, to the meeting ‚Äî the sight,
rather ‚Äî when it came. Every morning on going out to his
work he was positive he must pass the fellow on the darkish
stairs, but the stairs were empty; on the landing when he
opened his door, on the front-door steps when he returned
in the evening, but landing and steps were unoccupied. He
would have a good look at the door first from a little way
up the street, before coming to it, for the dread of meeting
was established, horribly established, in his being ‚Äî 'expectant
dread,' he called it. Then, suddenly, he did see him.
This was the second time.</p>
<p>'I was hardly settled at my desk in the Reading Room,'
he described the incident, 'when I found I'd left my employer's
letter on the mantelpiece. It had questions for me
to verify, you see. I hurried back for it. It only took five
minutes ‚Äî that's why the house suited me so ‚Äî but I had a
good squint first from a distance to see if the doorstep was
free. No one was visible. I ran up. Just as I slipped my latchkey
in, I glanced up ‚Äî something made me ‚Äî and there he
was, staring down at me from the window.'</p>
<p>'In your room!'</p>
<p>'I saw the face for the first time, but only for a second,
just long enough for our eyes to meet. He withdrew it
instantly ‚Äî awfully quick, I mean. It was dark, unshaven,
the beard not a real intended beard. I saw hanging lips. No,
it was not what you'd call an evil face, not in that sense,
but it was dreadful in the sense of being out of relation
with any world I knew. Horrible, appalling, in that way. It
was a mad face. Behind its darkness there was white ‚Äî the
white of terror. The face was all I really saw, with just a
bit of the neck that had a thin red scarf about it ‚Ä¶ The key
dropped out of my fingers with a clatter on the steps. I was
shaking all over.</p>
<p>'Ferreting about in my room! ‚Ä¶ was my first thought -
the room that used to be his! ‚Ä¶ But a second thought came
with it simultaneously, and it was this second thought that
unsettled me most, I believe. I realized in a flash that the
fellow had been actually watching me ever since my arrival,
keeping out of my way on purpose, waiting an opportunity,
waiting for me to go out ‚Äî oh, I can't describe it exactly -
but he knew my every moment, I mean.'</p>
<p>'You rushed up ‚Äî?' I interrupted. It was a stupid question,
but the dread of this mysterious lodger in my mind
excited me.</p>
<p>Moleson hesitated. 'I've got a vile temper, you know,' he
said, shyly rather, as though I was not supposed to be aware
of this, '<em>vile</em>', he repeated with emphasis and a touch of
shame, 'curiously sudden too ‚Äî'</p>
<p>'That brute in your own room,' I helped him. For a
moment I feared I was to hear of a violent assault.</p>
<p>'I was up those stairs in a second or two,' he went on,
'and the first thing I noticed on getting to the top was that
my door was moving. There was no one on the landing. The
room itself was empty.' He paused, looking at me significantly.
'The fellow,' he then added, 'had got out ‚Äî just in
time.' Again he paused for a moment. 'I shouldn't have
waited to ask any questions, you know.'</p>
<p>I knew he meant it, but I was glad to have been spared
details of an ugly assault. This savage temper in Moleson
always alarmed me rather. I verily believe he would have
done the fellow in. His face, as he told it, betrayed him. By
this time, moreover, I already had a shrewd suspicion of what
Was to prove the explanation of this unpleasant and mysterious
lodger: a mad mind certainly, a maniac probably (I
had glimpses of a homicidal maniac), he would turn out to
be the son of Mrs Smith. That I was partly right, yet at the
same time curiously wrong, is a tribute perhaps to the
unconscious skill with which Moleson told his story, concealing
its climax admirably, yet disdaining to mislead me
by using false clues.</p>
<p>The crime of murder, at any rate, was meanwhile spared
him. The room was empty, nothing had apparently been
touched, and the corridor was empty too. His suggestion of
having been 'watched' I disregarded. Later, however, I
inclined to accept it.</p>
<p>'Across my landing,' Moleson continued, 'was one door
only ‚Äî the door of what I felt convinced was his room. It
was closed. My first instinct was to bang at it and ask him
what the devil ‚Ä¶ Well,' ‚Äî he laughed a little ‚Äî 'I didn't do
it, that's all. My anger had cooled down somehow. I just
snatched up the letter I'd come to fetch and went back to
the Museum Reading Room.'</p>
<p>I looked at him, impressed by his admirable brevity, thinking
of the MC gained in Flanders, of that runaway he once
stopped, of the two hefty ruffians he fought, half killing one
of them, in a Surrey lane when they objected to his interfering
on behalf of their overloaded horses. He had various
things to his credit of this sort, and he was delicate, of slight
build, no muscles or brawn at all. Moleson, with his fierce,
perhaps great, spirit, was not negligible. Any story he told,
I mean, had value ‚Ä¶ 'Now,' I thought to myself, 'at last
we'll get to this business about waking up frightened!' Not
a bit of it. He must tell me something about Mrs Smith first.
And though it delayed the thing I wanted to hear, it was
worth listening to.</p>
<p>Poor lodging-houses have secrets, secret lodgers, as well,
no doubt. His room was cheap, too cheap. But it was not his
business, after all. 'Better leave it at that!' he decided. Only
one thing troubled me about Mrs Smith ‚Äî her interest,
namely, in ascertaining if he was 'not interfered with' ‚Äî as
though she had rather expected that he <em>would</em> be disturbed.
Her phrase had anchored itself in his mind; he was always
recalling it; he couldn't forget it apparently. Why should he
be 'interfered with'? What ‚Äî who ‚Äî should interfere with
him? Who, indeed, he reflected, but this man? This man
who had been turned out for him? This man whose room
he now undoubtedly occupied? And so it was that, since
Mrs Smith came to no closer terms with the real question
she longed to ask, he now, for his part, decided to come to
closer terms with the question <em>he</em> wanted to ask: 'Who is
your other lodger?' For the floor below being empty, he
knew, there was none but himself and this other lodger in
the house.</p>
<p>After various hints, suggestions and the rest, chances he
provided but she did not take, the expression in her face
invariably making him pause ‚Äî after numerous futile leads,
he came abruptly one day to the direct question. Tired of
fencing, a touch of his queer anger stirred in him. He made
up his mind to know whether her feelings were upset or
not. He put the brutal question, though he did it delicately
enough:</p>
<p>'By the by,' he said, as they were in the narrow hall,
money having just passed, 'I meant to ask you sooner, Mrs
Smith ‚Äî my typewriter at night ‚Äî does it disturb anyone?
The gentleman opposite, I mean?'</p>
<p>If he was prepared for evasion of some kind, he was certainly
not prepared for the answer he received.</p>
<p>'She denied there being any gentleman opposite at all?'
I asked, as Moleson hesitated, wondering, I fancied, how best
to make her answer sound credible to a Philistine like myself.</p>
<p>'She <em>didn't</em> answer,' he said briefly. 'Her face turned white
as a sheet. She fell back against the hatrack. She screamed.
It was a curious scream, rather low, not noisy a bit. And it
was pain, not fear. She was hurt, terribly hurt. She began
to cry ‚Ä¶ '</p>
<p>Further explanation of the amazing collapse, beyond
that her 'art caught me sudden ‚Äî it's always been weak,' ‚Äî
there was none. It was in this brief fashion that Moleson
related the incident, then left it there without another word
‚Äî as I too must therefore leave it.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>For some days after that nothing happened. He did not see
the lodger. He avoided the landlady. He began to look forward
to the end of his stay, hurrying his work at the Museum
purposely. But his mind was for ever going back, he says, to
that odd question about being 'interfered with', and one
night in particular, as he sat over his Notes after dinner,
memory carried him away rather forcibly, rather persistently,
to that phrase which had inserted his original uneasiness.
He sat in his chair, lolling back, and thinking about it,
wondering afresh about this mysterious lodger, about what
he did, why he hid so carefully, why he watched him. The
old notions slipped through his mind, for no new ones
occurred to him: was he a coiner of counterfeit money, a
blackmailer, a lunatic, a man wanted by the police, a man
who ought by rights to be shut up, a suicidal maniac ‚Ä¶
and so, eventually, he dropped asleep in his chair ‚Ä¶ to wake
up suddenly 'frightened, and in acute distress'.</p>
<p>So, at last, we had got to it.</p>
<p>It was late. The night was very still, all noises in the street
had stopped. No footsteps even were audible on the pavement
through the open window. 'I woke up cold,' he said,
'cold to the bone. The room, in spite of the warm summer
air, was icy. I was shivering.'</p>
<p>And at first, rather bewildered after his sleep, he sat there
listening, waiting, wondering why he felt cold, wondering
for some minutes what the matter was. That something
was the matter, he felt sure. Something had been happening,
had just happened, while he was asleep. But what? He collected
his senses, remembering exactly where he was.
Details, of course, came back quickly then. He says the first
thing he noticed was that a change had come over the room.
The room was somehow different. It had curiously altered.
When he dropped off to sleep it had been one thing, now it
was another. He glanced about him, searching uncomfortably
for evidence of this change, but finding no single detail
altered, nothing out of place, the furniture exactly as it
always was ‚Äî until his eye rested on the door. The door, he
phrased it, 'drew' his attention, although a closed door ‚Äî
and it was closed now ‚Äî must always, it seemed to me, look
much the same.</p>
<p>'Well,' he said, 'it didn't.' He used the tone of challenge,
anticipating disbelief. 'That door,' he declared, 'had been
opened and shut while I was asleep.' He waited a moment.
'It had only just been shut.'</p>
<p>The imaginative statement struck me as singularly dramatic.
Proof, of course, was not possible, yet a door, I reflected,
is easily the most significant feature of a house, opened,
closed, tapped on, locked; it is a frontier, a threshold, and
when passed, either in exit or entrance, leads necessarily to
other conditions of living, to other states of mind, since it
leads to other people and other atmosphere. I could understand
in a fashion that Moleson used those words. He rather
convinced me, I mean, that he was possibly right.</p>
<p>'That's what made you wake,' I offered, filling the pause
he left.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he returned flatly. 'While I slept, that door had
been opened, someone had looked in, come in, moved about
the room, done something, then gone out again ‚Äî gone out
just that instant.'</p>
<p>Aware of this change in the room, or in the atmosphere
about him, he sat for some time staring at that door. He
listened intently. A glance at his wrist-watch showed that
it was two in the morning, so that he had slept several hours,
The deep silence of the house came over him unpleasantly,
and his distress, instead of passing, increased. He found himself
still shivering. But a moment later his cold skin turned
hot and broke out in a profuse perspiration ‚Äî at a sound.
It was a sound he recognized, having heard it before: the
dragging of furniture or luggage across the landing, of heavy
and awkward articles, difficult to move. He had heard it
already several times, late at night, early in the morning,
through his dreams as well, and he had always ascribed it to
the lodger, busy arranging things in his room opposite, and
using the landing sometimes in so doing. He had paid no
particular attention to it, beyond a passing annoyance at
the choice of hours, and the sounds had usually ceased after
a few minutes at the most. Now, however, he was conscious
of a difference, for in the first place it was two in the morning,
when ordinary people were asleep; secondly, he realized
distinctly, it was not furniture or luggage being moved ‚Äî
it was a piece of luggage, a heavy piece, for the sound was
unmistakable. He thought of a trunk or portmanteau. Moreover
‚Äî it was going on immediately outside his own door.</p>
<p>'The fellow was dragging this luggage of his across the
landing just beyond my door,' Moleson underlined the fact.
'At two o'clock in the morning, if you please!'</p>
<p>The first effect upon him was one of a queer paralysis,
mental and physical. He could neither think nor move.</p>
<p>'I just sat listening to the fellow dragging his great bag,
or whatever it was, across the landing ‚Äî dragging it, I supposed,
towards his own room opposite. Then, very gradually,
my mental numbness lifted, and I found myself wondering
why. At two in the morning! Dragging luggage about!
What was he doing with luggage on the landing of a Bloomsbury
lodging-house at that unearthly hour? So close to my
own door too? The bumping and scraping were audible
enough; there was no pretence of doing it quietly. Where
was he taking his luggage from? Where to? My mind
worked quickly, once it started. A score of questions rushed
over me. What could it be, this bag, this portmanteau, this
heavy bundle so difficult to move? What could it contain?
What had he put inside it? Taken?'</p>
<p>'Taken? ‚Ä¶ ' I repeated, not quite following him.</p>
<p>'Some of the questions, racing through my mind,' he explained,
'brought a kind of answer with them. That's the
only way I can put it,' he added apologetically, a sop to me,
the sceptical recipient of his confession.</p>
<p>'What had he taken?' he repeated, looking at me rather
hard.</p>
<p>I had no notion.</p>
<p>'But I had,' said Moleson with decision, interpreting my
blank expression,</p>
<p>'I guessed at once ‚Äî half guessed, at least.'</p>
<p>He had me at a loss there, I admit; but I made no comment,
merely nodding my head affirmatively. His next
words took me completely by surprise:</p>
<p>'His great bag or bundle, whatever it was,' whispered
Moleson, 'contained something he had just taken out of my
room, While I slept, the fellow had sneaked in, crept about,
found what he wanted, taken it, and sneaked out again with
it ‚Äî in his bag.'</p>
<p>Again I made no comment, the explanation being too
preposterous to argue about. Moleson, besides, was now too
earnest and convinced ‚Äî he knew, remember, the climax,
whereas I was still in ignorance ‚Äî too eager to make his full
confession for me to interfere and cavil with commonplace
criticism. It might have stopped him, for one thing ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>'You missed anything?' I asked, no disbelief in my face
or voice. I had to repeat it before he replied, and his reply,
when it came, again took me by surprise. Also, it sent a
shiver through me, as though the hair were moving on my
scalp:</p>
<p>'What he had taken,' he told me in a lowered voice, and
speaking very slowly, 'was not in my room at that time ‚Äî
when I fell asleep, I mean. But it had been there ‚Äî some
time before.'</p>
<p>The statement, naturally, left me without a rejoinder. I
lit a cigarette and waited in silence.</p>
<p>'At that moment,' he said impressively, still in his whisper,
and loathing coming into his face with a leap, as it were, 'I
knew ‚Äî he was a ‚Äî horror. Oh, in every meaning of the
word. And a queer, sudden revulsion rushed over me ‚Äî the
intense desire to see him close, to look at him face to face,
to speak to him ‚Äî I never once heard his voice, you know
‚Äî to ‚Äî yes, even to touch the brute; and in so doing ‚Äî somehow
‚Äî God knows how ‚Äî to get rid of him. So far he had
avoided me deliberately. All this time he had evaded,
escaped me. He <em>meant</em> to avoid and escape me, but now at
last I had him close ‚Äî a few feet away ‚Äî busy, occupied,
within reach, unable to get away ‚Äî if I just opened that door,
I need only open that door, and I should see him ‚Äî catch him
in the act.'</p>
<p>Longing to ask 'In what act?' I ventured instead: 'You felt
angry all of a sudden?' and hit the mark better than I knew.</p>
<p>He admitted it, ashamed a little, with a nod. 'I felt cold
all over, mind you,' he went on, always in that low voice,
'scared as well, really scared, but at the same time, as you
say, I felt' ‚Äî he chose a queer word ‚Äî 'vicious. Exasperated,
too, a bit. I wanted to be done with it. I wanted to get at the
fellow. Why the devil should he make this infernal row at
two in the morning? How dared he? How dared he come
into another man's room, even if it had once been his own?
Why should he watch me, bother me, haunt me, get into
my mind ‚Äî and all the rest of it? Yes,' ‚Äî with a touch of
fierceness ‚Äî 'you're right ‚Äî I did feel angry all of a sudden. I
decided abruptly I'd go out ‚Äî'</p>
<p>'Open that door?' ‚Äî I simply couldn't keep it back. Personally,
I should not have opened that door at two in the
morning under the circumstances.</p>
<p>'Yes, open the door, go out, and tell the brute to go to
hell. I decided to do that ‚Äî and more ‚Äî'</p>
<p>I knew what that 'more' meant.</p>
<p>'‚Äî but when I tried to get up from my chair, I found I
couldn't move. I just sat there, furious angry, struggling ‚Äî
like a mechanical doll whose machinery had run down. I
was dying to get at the fellow. I was perspiring all over. I
felt that if he answered back, showed any insolence, I'd ‚Äî
strangle him ‚Äî just go for him and be done with it. Throttle
the devil! I felt my fingers at his throat, the prickle of his
filthy beard, saw his hanging lips drop wider as he fought
for breath, his beastly eyes bulge out, his face turn black ‚Äî
oh, I was in this odd, sudden fury, I admit ‚Äî and yet ‚Äî I
couldn't move an inch.</p>
<p>'Perhaps ‚Äî probably ‚Äî I made a noise of some kind -
cursed aloud most likely, but anyhow the sound of the
dragging luggage suddenly stopped. A deep, rather an extraordinary,
silence followed. I could hear the blood beating
in my head. I sat fixed in my chair like a dummy, staring at
the door. Only that door separated us. He existed there ‚Äî
breathing, vivid, intense ‚Äî a few feet from where I sat rigid
in my chair, unable to get at him, unable to move a muscle.
He seemed to exert some tremendous pressure on me,
paralysing my will, holding me helpless where I was.'</p>
<p>Moleson mopped his forehead a moment.</p>
<p>'I was so angry,' he went on, rather breathless now in his
excitement, as though he lived over again his fury and exasperation,
'that I felt murder in me. Positively, I felt myself
a murderer.'</p>
<p>Curiously, he stopped dead suddenly. A look of shyness
came over him. He stared at me, I stared back at him. Such
language, of course, in anybody else, would have been
merely extravagant, hysterical. In his case it was real. I
knew his sudden, ungovernable temper; I knew, too, he was
ashamed of it. In a less civilized country he must always
have been in trouble with his gun. He was the type that saw
red and killed. And a quick flash of understanding somehow
came into me, so that I guessed in that instant the explanation
both of his abrupt pause and of his queer shyness. Having
this dangerous thing in himself, he recognized it in others
too. That sympathy existed.</p>
<p>'That's how I knew,' he muttered, looking down, having
guessed my thought.</p>
<p>'What <em>he</em> was?' I asked, fumbling With my cigarette.</p>
<p>'A murderer,' he said quietly.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I waited in silence, wondering what he was going to tell
me. His face was rather white, his excitement only kept
under by his doubt of being believed. It was best now, I
felt, to ask no questions. In his own way he would presently
go on. But curiosity, I confess, devoured me. Did he open
that door? Did he see the other fellow, speak to him, touch
him, perhaps go for him?</p>
<p>His own mind, however, was an odd psychological revelation
‚Äî of himself.</p>
<p>'And the instant I realized <em>that</em>,' he went on, 'the power
to move came back to me. My muscles acted. The pressure
the fellow exerted was lifted, because we understood one
another. There was that ghastly sympathy between us. I
got out of my chair and crossed the floor. I reached the
door. Then I stopped a moment and listened. He, too, I
knew, was listening a few inches away from my face,
nothing but half an inch of thin boards between us, listening
to my movements, bending to the keyhole probably, crouching,
his luggage neglected for a moment while he waited to
see what I was going to do. A second later I caught the
handle, turned it, and flung the door wide open with a rush.</p>
<p>'There he was before me. Quite close. He was bending
down, exactly as I had imagined, crouching, his head
lowered; and at his feet, less than a yard beyond me, I saw
on the floor the dark blotch that was his luggage.</p>
<p>'What happened then happened so quickly that it seemed
less than a second. From the stooping position he did not
rise, nor make any attempt to rise. One hand, still stretched
out upon the bag, began to work. He pulled at it. He had
been pulling at it when I opened the door, and he went on
pulling at it ‚Äî dragging it, dragging it away from me, away
from the door, and across the landing floor. I, for my part,
had one hand raised to strike, to clutch, to kill if necessary,
but my hand did not fall, I did nothing violent, because I
made in that very instant a horrible discovery. I suddenly
realized that he did not see me. He had not noticed me. He
was not aware of my being there close beside him. He did
not react to my presence in any way, because he was simply
not conscious of it. He continued doing what he had been
doing just before ‚Äî dragging his luggage across the landing
floor. I saw the dark mass of it go hitching along in jerks as
he pulled. It was very heavy.</p>
<p>'And this ‚Äî this not being aware of me, I mean ‚Äî came
as a tremendous shock. The surprise of it, perhaps. It was
the last thing in the world I'd expected. I had rather looked
for something sudden, violent. I was prepared for it. This
way he just ignored me turned me cold. It struck me as
unnatural. I stood and stared, for I didn't know what else
to do, and my body was trembling, and I felt queerly uncertain
of my legs. I watched him go on dragging at that heavy
thing, which I now saw was not luggage after all, not ordinary
luggage, at least. It was neither bag nor portmanteau,
nor anything like that. It was a sack of awkward shape and
outline, It was unpleasant, I thought, the way it bulged. But
more than that, more than unusual, it gave me a turn ‚Äî I
felt it somewhere awful. And realizing this, I made an
unconscious movement evidently, for I felt my breath catch,
and { must have staggered a little. I caught at the edge of
the door to steady myself, and the door, naturally, yielded
with my weight; I lurched with it, sideways at first, then a
little outwards as the door came with me, and then ‚Äî forwards.
Before I could recover balance, I was against him. I
was right into him.</p>
<p>'But I didn't fall. I didn't, thank God, collide with the
monstrous creature and his awful sack, but I was so close
against him that the shock of finding nothing solid ‚Äî there
was no substance there at all ‚Äî stopped my heart for a
second. It seemed to rush up into my throat. Then my breath
came back, and I let out a yell into the night that must have
been heard in the street. At which moment, still dragging at
his bundle, he made a sudden, rather violent, movement. He
turned in a new way. I saw his face clearly.</p>
<p>'By &quot;clearly&quot; I mean close ‚Äî dreadfully close. It was
turned up, but I saw it obliquely rather, a kind of sideways
glimpse, and even then he wasn't looking at me. The light
from the open door behind fell on it, and I saw the eyes,
blazing eyes, the hanging lips, the white skin smudged with
unshaven hair of the growing black beard, and ‚Äî to my
utter amazement ‚Äî tears upon the cheeks. It was a maniac's
face, if ever I saw one. The other thing that I saw clearly
was that the thin red scarf about the neck was not a scarf
at all. It was a thin red line of contused blood in the flesh of
the neck itself, a line that only a rope, drawn very tightly,
could have made.'</p>
<p>Moleson stopped then and sank back in his chair, looking
away from me, and glad, I think, that he had got so far
without interruption. His words and manner, his facial expression
above all, conveyed his horror far better than his
jerked-out sentences, I smoked a moment in silence, handing
him a cigarette too, which he refused. But he said nothing
for some little time, while I also kept back a dozen questions
that rushed up in me.</p>
<p>'What happened then?' I ventured at length. 'What did
you do?'</p>
<p>'Nothing,' he replied briefly, looking up at me again, his
manner now quiet and collected. 'I did nothing. It seemed,
somehow, there was nothing I wanted to do. A feeling I
must shout, strike out, do something violent passed. What
was done next, <em>he</em> did. I merely looked on and watched.
There was no emotion in me of any sort. I was just numb.
My whole consciousness, I think, was in my eyes.'I stared
‚Ä¶ as he went on dragging that heavy mass across the landing,
always a little farther from me, hitching and shoving it
along with great effort ‚Äî towards the door of his room. Then
he opened the door, but the light from my room did not
reach to it, and as it was not lit inside, I saw nothing but a
black space. I watched. I saw everything he did, every movement
he made. He stepped to one side, across the bundle, so
that he was then pushing instead of dragging. His whole body
was bent double with the effort to get the thing through the
door and inside the room. Apparently it was difficult to do.
He accomplished it after several minutes. He closed the
door, putting his weight against it heavily from outside, and
then ‚Äî after that ‚Äî well ‚Äî he wasn't there any more.'</p>
<p>'He'd gone into the room?'</p>
<p>Moleson shrugged his shoulders. 'Can't say,' he answered
rather curtly. 'I tell you he simply wasn't there. I couldn't
see him any more. I'd lost sight of him.' He added sheepishly:
'Something happened to my eyes, I suppose. I didn't
see him go ‚Äî but he was gone.'</p>
<p>Fully five minutes passed, Moleson then told me slowly,
before he could think, much less move. He was struck dumb
with terror and amazement. He felt stupid, empty of life,
unable to act at all.</p>
<p>'It may have been five minutes,' he said, 'but it may just
as well have been twenty ‚Äî for all I know. The only thing
I remember clearly is that my awful yell ‚Äî that wild shriek I
let out into the night some time before ‚Äî still seemed to me
echoing through the house and down the stairs. I had a feeling
it must have been heard in the street and the police
would be in. But nothing happened. The fellow's disappearance
bewildered me to a point I can't describe properly. I
<em>knew</em> I hadn't been dreaming, but I knew damned little else,
it seems to me.</p>
<p>'I moved at last, after a bit. I moved backwards. I threw
my own door as wide as it would go, so as to get all the
light there was, and the light streamed across the landing
and fell on the door ‚Äî his door. I knew I was going to open
that door. I had to.'</p>
<p>His pluck hardly surprised me, for I already knew it. I
admired it. Nothing in this world or the next could have
induced me to go near that door, much less open it. Moleson,
however, did more: he went over and knocked loudly
against its boards.</p>
<p>'The sound echoed,' he told me, 'but not inside. It echoed
down the stairs, I mean. The boards sounded dull. That dullness
explained itself,' he added, with a quick glance up at
me as though, of course, I understood what he meant. But I
did not understand, and my eyebrows went up in query and
response. 'lt wasn't an ordinary door,' he said.</p>
<p>'You ‚Äî opened it?' I had no inkling what he meant.</p>
<p>'I guessed it wasn't a proper door,' he replied, changing
his adjective, but leaving me more ignorant than before.
'I'd felt that some time before.'</p>
<p>'Sham? ‚Ä¶ '</p>
<p>'Not an ordinary door into an ordinary room,' he explained,
with a hint of impatience at my stupidity. 'When I
knocked,' he went on, 'and got no answer, I knew I was
right. The dead sound proved it.'</p>
<p>'Oh! ‚Ä¶ '</p>
<p>'Yes,' he went on quietly, 'the dead muffled sound it made.
I waited a moment. Then I opened it. It was the door of a
cupboard ‚Äî a rather shallow cupboard.' He paused, then
said something that made my blood curdle: 'That's why the
creature had to shove it in so hard ‚Äî <em>stuff</em> it in ‚Äî to make it
stay ‚Äî'</p>
<p>'Upright? ‚Ä¶ ' I gasped, catching the ghastly meaning at
last.</p>
<p>'Upright,' was all he replied.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The dusk was now fallen into our room between us, and I
saw the glow of my cigarette-end in the mirror, behind his
chair. It had been a dreadful story. I longed for light and a
glass of whisky. Moleson had so convinced me of the truth,
the reality, of his confession, yet I got the feeling that he
hoped I would tear it to pieces and demolish it utterly, proving
to his satisfaction how absurd it all was, and using nice
words like hallucination, overwrought nerves, and the like.</p>
<p>Instead, I remained rather quiet and non-committal, and
certainly dumb; I could not honestly comfort him in the
way he wished.</p>
<p>'I told you,' he resumed, his voice much lower now, 'that
I imagined that shriek of mine still echoing in the house and
down the stairs? Well, a few moments later, while I still
stood glaring at that ghastly cupboard, all black and empty
‚Ä¶ I heard a sound on the stairs. It was below me, coming
nearer, I couldn't move ‚Äî not an inch, one way or the other.
I was just stuck to the floor. But I felt sure of one thing ‚Äî
it wasn't ‚Äî but he couldn't say the word he meant, the word
in his mind ‚Äî 'it wasn't' ‚Äî He stuck again.</p>
<p>'<em>Who</em> was it?' I asked quickly, eager to help him, but to
help myself at the same time.</p>
<p>'I saw the light first,' he said, 'the light of a candle, evidently,
flickering on the wall, then on the ceiling. Next
came the shadow, enormously magnified and grotesque.
Then came a large white face of melancholy and terror
mixed, looming at me over the banisters. There was a thin
voice:</p>
<p>'&quot; ‚Ä¶ interfered with ‚Ä¶ &quot; I heard from what seemed an
immense distance. ‚Ä¶ &quot;He showed hisself, then, did he?
‚Ä¶ May God forgive me ‚Ä¶&quot; and something about a &quot;broken
promise&quot; and a &quot;room I didn't oughter 'ave let to anyone
‚Ä¶ &quot; And then, as, to my shame, I felt myself being
helped up from the floor ‚Äî for I had no idea I had let my
legs give way like that ‚Äî something ‚Äî oh, horrible and dreadful
‚Äî about &quot; ‚Ä¶ they 'anged him for it; oh, they 'anged him
at the Scrubs ‚Ä¶ it was 'is own father, you see ‚Ä¶ and now
over twenty years ago ‚Ä¶ &quot;'</p>
<p>There were gulping sounds, he remembers, and these odd,
broken words.</p>
<p>Moleson, curiously enough, had never gone to the trouble
to verify anything, and it was my vile curiosity that had to
find its own satisfaction. The British Museum, where he had
worked so hard, gave me certain facts in the newspapers of
long before the war. The 'Warley Parricide', I discovered,
and the unpleasant details about how the body was found
stuffed into a cupboard, and how the public signed a petition
and the lawyers urged homicidal mania, but without the
intended result. The Home Secretary, one paper dared to
mention, had married again and had stepsons of his own ‚Ä¶</p>
