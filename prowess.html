    <h1>Prowess 2000, 3000, &amp; FS<sup>2</sup></h1>
    <p>Prowess 2000 was a radiation therapy treatmnent planning system sold by Small Systems Group, Inc of Chico, CA.

        The company name was later shortented to SSGI to remove the word "small" from company literature.
        
        With the release of Version 3, the product was rebranded as Prowess 3000 to empasize its improved support for
        multi-planar (typically 2&ndash;3) planning which was casually described as 2Â½&ndash;D. 
        
        Prowess treatment planning operated IBM-compatibile computer systems that were readily available and likely to be
        familiar to the customer.
        
        Complete systems were conifgured at the company facility and shipped to the site for setup by the customer.
        
        At that time, personal computers had come to be available by mail order and this formed part of the product
        vision as a "mail-order" treatment planning system
        
        Two-days of optional on-site training was available at the time of purchase for those who who wanted it.
        Supportive, real-time phone support was a prioprit.</p>
