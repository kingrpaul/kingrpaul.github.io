			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>The suitability of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor for use in radiography, especially
				medical radiography, is investigated. Radiography and the parameters of a radiographic sensor are
				described. The quantum limitation on radiography is described and exposure limitations are used to
				justify a square sensor element with side length of 100 μm. Due to the biological hazards associated
				with ionizing radiation, the requirement is adopted for medical radiography that each x-ray photon give
				rise to a detectable response in the sensor. A sensor element made of a MOS capacitor and phosphor is
				described. Bounds on expected phosphor performance are justified. The MOS capacitor structure,
				materials, and operation are described. A test structure MOS capacitor is used to evaluate the
				suitability of the MOS capacitor for use in a radiography sensor element.</p>
			<p>Mathematical techniques for characterizing a MOS capacitor are described. A method is developed for
				calculating a MOS capacitor's quantum efficiency. This method includes a correction for thermal charge
				generation. The latitude (i.e. maximum permissible exposure) of the described sensor element is
				calculated to be well in excess of the requirements of medical radiography. The quantum efficiency of an
				oversized (330 μm side square) MOS capacitor is determined to be 7% for optical photons of wavelength
				540 nm. This wavelength was chosen for measurement based upon phosphor emission spectra. Using the best
				and worst case phosphor performance, the number of expected charges per x-ray photon was calculated. To
				detect the influence of a single x-ray photon, readout circuits must resolve a charge packet containing
				between 83 and 109 electrons. This is a very small charge and will likely not be resolvable within the
				constraints of this sensor. The measured quantum efficiency is unusually small and possible techniques
				to improve this value are described.</p>
			<p>To correct the quantum efficiency measurement for thermal generation, the thermal generation properties
				of the MOS capacitor were measured. Thermal generation was observed to be unusually slow with the MOS
				capacitor taking 50 minutes to equilibrate at room temperature in the dark.</p>

				<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
				<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
			</header>
			<p>The research reported here was conducted as part of an ongoing effort to develop a large scale, solid
				state electronic device for use as a digital sensor in both medical and industrial radiography. Though
				this work is pertinent to both applications, emphasis is given to medical radiography.</p>
			<p>The starting point for this research is the work reported by Jacobs<small><sup>1</sup></small>. It was
				shown that through the use of multiple stepped exposures and additive image reconstruction, a bare
				dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) integrated circuit (IC) can be used to acquire high quality, small
				scale, digital, radiographic images. The architecture of a DRAM makes it awkward to use for radiography.
				Large radiation exposures and acquisition times are required. Large radiation exposures and acquisition
				times are unacceptable in medical radiography. In addition, accumulated radiation exposure limits the
				useful lifetime of a DRAM, thus large exposures are unacceptable for such a device in an industrial
				environment. High sensitivity is a requirement for both an industrial and a medical, solid-state,
				radiographic sensor. The bare DRAM is not an acceptable image sensor in either application. In addition
				to operational and survivability problems, the DRAM architecture is such that it is not feasible to
				attempt to scale it up to a large size (e.g. 11" x 14").</p>
			<p>A more appropriate architecture than that of a DRAM must be developed for use in an electronic
				radiography sensor. A suitable architecture will use digitization of photogenerated charge acquired
				during a single exposure. Such an architecture must be based around some electronic device which
				functions as the fundamental sensor element. The metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor is the
				fundamental charge storage element in a DRAM and the fundamental sensor element in a
				charge-coupled-device (CCD). It is well suited to large scale device fabrication. Therefore, it seems a
				likely first candidate for investigation. The object of this research is to investigate the MOS
				capacitor for use as the fundamental sensor element in a digital radiography system. The objectives are
				to model the device's performance as a sensor element and to evaluate its suitability for this task.</p>
			<p>Chapter 2 examines the radiography process. It evaluates the objectives of radiography, its inherent
				limitations, and the role of the radiographic sensor. The performance parameters of interest are
				discussed, performance goals are defined for medical radiography, and some assumptions about operating
				conditions are established.</p>
			<p>Chapter 3 discusses the MOS capacitor. Its structure, materials, and mechanisms of charge generation and
				transport are considered.</p>
			<p>Chapter 4 discusses the use of the MOS capacitor in radiography. A proposed sensor element geometry is
				described. Two possible phosphor capabilities are described and justified for use as the best and worst
				case of an achievable phosphor capability. Expected performance parameters are determined and criteria
				for medical use are calculated. Issues pertaining to signal readout and processing are described, an
				expected response to imaging parameters is discussed, and the implications of radiation damage are
				briefly introduced. The issue of radiation damage has been addressed by other investigators1. Its action
				is to degrade the performance of the MOS capacitor as well as other electronic components ultimately
				leading to device failure. A DRAM is sufficiently robust to radiation exposure that interest in a solid
				state image sensor has not been discouraged. The issues of electronic radiation damage and its
				implications to system performance and survivability are not closed and deserve additional consideration
				in later work. They do not receive that consideration here. The interest here is focused on the
				performance of the unirradiated MOS capacitor and not how that performance degrades with exposure.</p>
			<p>Chapter 5 discusses an IC which contains MOS capacitors which were used for investigation. In addition,
				other devices which were used for data collection are described.</p>
			<p>Chapter 6 discusses the methods used to characterize a MOS capacitor. A model of thermal charge
				generation is described and a model of charge generation under illumination is proposed. A technique of
				calculating thermal charge generation parameters is described, as are methods of calculating total
				charge generation rates. A method for calculating the quantum efficiency (efficiency for converting
				optical photons to charge carriers) is described.</p>
			<p>Chapter 7 reports the characteristics of sample MOS capacitors fabricated using the Metal Oxide
				Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS). The doping profiles of n-type and p-type MOS capacitors
				are determined and a preference for n-type MOS capacitors is tentatively established and justified. The
				thermal generation parameters of an n-type MOS capacitor are calculated and reported. The latitude of
				the test IC MOS capacitor is determined and compared to the latitude requirements for medical
				radiography. The absolute quantum conversion efficiency of an n-type MOS capacitor at the optical
				wavelength of interest (540 nm) is calculated and shown to be constant during an exposure cycle.</p>
			<p>Chapter 8 investigates the implications of the MOS capacitor's characteristics on its use in medical
				radiography. The requirements which they place on readout circuitry is determined. Suggested directions
				for further work are then outlined.</p>

			<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
			<h2>THE DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY PROCESS</h2>

			<h3>Radiography</h3>
			<p>When an object of unknown composition and internal structure is illuminated by a beam of penetrating
				radiation whose properties are known, properties of the radiation which exits the object can be measured
				to draw conclusions about the composition and structure of the object. If the objective of this process
				is to learn how materials are distributed in the object, then this process is known as radiography.</p>
			<h4>Image Formation</h4>
			<p>In radiography, information about the composition of the object is encoded on the properties of the
				carrier beam. By possessing knowledge about the encoding processes and the carrier beam, it is possible
				to decode information about the object from measured properties of the emerging radiation. As a
				practical matter, measuring the properties of the emerging radiation is not trivial and therefore every
				effort is made to keep the properties of the illuminating beam as simple as possible so that the
				required decoding is minimized. As an example, consider the following simple case. Suppose that to image
				an object which has x, y, and z dimensions, it is illuminated by a beam of uniform flux, I, from the -z
				direction. If the quanta of the illuminating beam are monodirectional and monoenergetic, the beam has
				planar symmetry (i.e. no variation in intensity along the x and y directions), and only the uncollided
				emerging flux (ΦO) is measured, then the two dimensional information which is encoded on the magnitude
				of the uncollided flux is the two dimensional distribution of transmission factors, e-P(x,y) as
				described by Equation 2-1. P(x,y) is the optical path length of the object at (x,y). Figure 2-1
				illustrates this situation.</p>

			<p>Note that the spatial variation of the uncollided flux is an incomplete description of the emerging beam.
				As such, it provides only incomplete information about the object. A complete description of the object
				at location (x,y) would tell what the range of z for the object is at (x,y), what material elements are
				located there, and how they are distributed along z. The optical path length has this information
				integrated together as shown in Equation 2-2.</p>

				<figcaption>Figure 2-1: Representation of Transmission Radiography</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>The simple form of radiography described here is the most common. The beam geometry is approximated by
				using a very small source of radiation which is located much further from the object than the distance
				between the object and sensor. Non-monochromatic radiation such as that produced by a bremsstrahlung
				source of x-ray illumination is often used. This results in an averaging process over the
				energy-dependent interaction coefficients. Sometimes, a non-planar, non-uniform illuminating beam is
				used so that when the object information is encoded on it, the image will have properties useful for the
				application. For example, a beam with spherical symmetry can be used to obtain magnification in two
				dimensions. This effect is unavoidable when the distance between the object and the sensor is not
				negligible in comparison to the distance between the source and the object. A beam with cylindrical
				symmetry can be used to obtain magnification in only one dimension. Though this is not common, it would
				be a consideration in performing transmission radiography with a collimated detector and a line source.
				In addition, a planar beam can be made non-uniform to allow meaningful and simultaneous imaging of
				optically thick and thin objects. An example of this is the use of the bowtie filter in CT imaging.</p>
			<p>In transmission radiography, no attempt is usually made to detect and interpret scattered radiation, and
				all the object information which it carries is wasted. Instead, great efforts are made to prevent
				scattered radiation from reaching the image sensor. Any scattered radiation which is detected by the
				image sensor contributes undesired information to the image. This undesired information mimics image
				noise. </p>
			<h4>Image Sensing</h4>
			<p>As the beam exits the object, it must be intercepted by an image sensor which is able to measure the
				uncollided flux and its spatial variation with x and y. Unfortunately, it is not always a simple matter
				to isolate the uncollided from the scattered flux or distinguish between them. The function of the image
				sensor is to provide a two dimensional signal, S(x,y) (i.e. a change in some measurable property of the
				sensor which can vary across its lateral dimensions) in response to the uncollided flux which reaches
				it. In radiography, any rejection of scatter generally occurs in devices external to the sensor since
				the sensor's response is a function of the total angular-integrated flux which reaches it. Since
				conventional radiography sensors typically provide only a time-integrated, energy-weighted signal, the
				sensor's response is a function of the energy fluence (exposure) which is incident on it. Metal halide
				film is the most commonly used radiography sensor. It changes its opacity (optical density) in response
				to the energy fluence which is incident on it. In the medical environment, radiographic film is commonly
				used with one or more layers of scintillating material placed in contact with it. This is done to
				improve the film's ability to intercept x-ray photons and to increase the response of the film to x-ray
				photons which are intercepted. In the medical environment, this is necessary to minimize the patient
				dose required to obtain a diagnostic quality image. In the industrial environment, lead intensifying
				screens are more common and are used to reduce the time required to acquire an image of sufficient
				quality.</p>
			<h4>Digital Radiography</h4>
			<p>If the image sensor is intentionally discretized both spatially and in its response variable, it is said
				to be a digital radiography sensor. Radiography is performed with fields of radiation made up of
				discrete quanta. These quanta undergo binary interactions (Compton scatter and photoelectric absorption
				being the most important) in the object to form the x-ray image. The emerging quanta are detected
				individually by the image sensor to form the recorded image. Though not necessarily digital, all
				radiography is inherently discrete. In this discussion, a digital radiography sensor refers to an array
				of sensor elements each of which is capable of absorbing an x-ray photon and converting it to a packet
				of stored charges. Such a sensor must also have some sort of automatic readout mechanism which is able
				to prepare an electronic image in a format suitable for a digital computer.</p>
			<h4>Medical Radiography</h4>
			<p>The process of forming a medical radiograph involves the interplay of two potential hazards. Ionizing
				radiation causes damage in biological systems. The most significant form of damage at the exposure
				levels of interest is genetic damage which can lead to long term, life threatening conditions. However,
				insufficient or misleading image information can lead to improper medical treatment and present
				immediate hazards to a patient. Therefore, every effort must be made to extract the maximum possible
				information from the minimum possible exposure in a diagnostic examination. This means two things. Every
				effort must be made to absorb each useful x-ray photon which has passed through the patient. In
				addition, each x-ray photon which is absorbed must give rise to a significant change in the radiographic
				sensor. For digital imaging, the charge generated by an x-ray photon absorbed in a pixel must correspond
				to a resolvable grey level for that pixel.</p>
			<h4>Radiation Source</h4>
			<p>To exploit the different energy dependencies of the interaction probabilities of body constituents,
				filtered bremsstrahlung x-ray sources are used which have controllable peak energies. Typically,
				diagnostic exams use peak energies between 50 and 120 kev. To achieve acceptable contrast, mammographic
				x-ray spectra typically have peak energies between 30 and 50 keV. Teletherapy portal imaging is forced
				to use much higher peak energies with the result of very poor primary contrast and scatter rejection.
				Portal imaging and mammography are special radiographic problems and immediate consideration is limited
				to the case of general radiography.</p>
			<p>In later chapters it is necessary to perform calculations which depend on the energy of an x-ray photon.
				Calculations based upon energy spectra are complicated to perform. Meaningful calculations based upon
				energy spectra require a detailed estimate of the x-ray spectrum to be used. In addition, x-ray spectra
				differ from one x-ray source to another and from one examination to another. Therefore, it is either
				necessary to perform calculations based upon many different spectra or base calculations on some sort of
				average spectrum or a simplifying assumption. For this work, a monoenergetic beam of 40 keV photons is
				taken as representative of an average beam used in diagnostic radiography. Since it does not describe
				any actual diagnostic x-ray beam, this approximation introduces some errors. However, the average peak
				energy lies somewhere in the range listed, the average energy in a spectrum lies below its peak, and
				imaging beams are hardened before they reach the sensor. Therefore this is a reasonable approximation.
			</p>

			<h4>Logarithmic Detection</h4>

			<p>Metal halide film was the first and remains the most popular radiography sensor. Microscopic grains in a
				piece of radiographic film change their state and become optically opaque as they are exposed.
				Therefore, radiographic film records image information by darkening in response to exposure. As film
				grains are exposed, they are no longer available to be exposed and film sensitivity (rate of darkening
				with respect to incident flux) declines linearly with accumulated exposure. Due to this, the darkness of
				an area of radiographic film is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the exposure and is thus
				linearly proportional to P(x,y), the optical path length. This proportionality does not hold for very
				small exposures and ceases to hold for very large exposures as the film saturates. Radiographic film was
				not developed to record P(x,y) and it is not obvious that P(x,y) is the description of the body which is
				most clinically relevant or useful.</p>
			<p>It is also not obvious that a sensor element developed for used as a radiography sensor will record
				P(x,y). In fact, unless the physics of operation are similar, P(x,y) is not expected to be recorded. If
				the sensor provides a response which is proportional to accumulated exposure (similar to an integrating
				Anger camera), the relationship between its response and the object optical path length is expected to
				be greater than linear. In other words, if a sensor does not lose its sensitivity during an exposure, it
				will be more sensitive to large exposures than a sensor which does. In such a case, the plot of response
				against optical path length has a positive second derivative and its shape is similar to that of a
				parabola. When S(x,y) (the response of the sensor at a given position) is plotted against P(x,y) (the
				optical path length at a given position), the resulting graph is known as a Hurter and Driffield (H&D)
				Plot. If P(x,y) is the description of the object which is of interest, an electronic image can be
				processed to yield a linear H&D Plot. </p>

			<h4>Photon Stopping and Amplification</h4>

			<p>Radiographic film is virtually transparent to x-rays and any x-ray which interacts with it produces a
				very small response. Since medical radiography must get the greatest possible information for the
				smallest possible exposure, steps are taken to improve the cross section and response of film to x-rays.
				Rare earth salt screens are often placed in close contact with film to absorb the x-rays, create optical
				photons and transmit those optical photons to the film. The screen's ability to absorb x-ray photons is
				primarily governed by its thickness. Since light photons spread in the phosphor, screens blur the image
				that they form and obscure fine detail. A graph of the intensity of a sensor's response against the
				spatial frequency of the object is known as a modulation transfer function (MTF). The spatial
				distribution of a sensor's response to a single x-ray photon is known as its point-spread-function
				(PSF). The PSF and MTF are related by the Fourier transform. To say that an intensifying phosphor tends
				to obscure fine detail is equivalent to saying that its MTF takes on low values for high spatial
				frequencies. Such a device is known as a low-pass spatial filter. An intensifying phosphor is a low-pass
				filter and as such attenuates high-frequency image information and high-frequency image noise. Other
				means of increasing the film's response to x-rays which are absorbed include increasing the grain size
				and increasing the development time. These also act at the expense of the MTF. A compromise between a
				wide-band MTF and high sensitivity must be made in designing an image sensor.</p>
			<p>Electronic systems are more flexible than radiographic film. Once a film is exposed and developed, it is
				very difficult to enhance its appearance and a film which is too light or too dark must be repeated. The
				first film is discarded and the radiation dose absorbed by the patient during the first exposure is
				wasted. In contrast, it is a relatively simple matter to apply gain to an electronic signal or multiply
				the contents of a computer register by a constant. For an electronic image, it need not be a
				consideration that the information available cannot be seen because the film is too light or too dark.
				Using window and level controls, any amount of image information can be presented in a viewable form. Of
				course, amplification cannot provide image information which was not acquired by the sensor. Good sensor
				performance is still required and a sensor which is completely saturated during an exposure still relays
				no information.</p>
			<h4>Resolution and Contrast</h4>
			<p>As described above, enhancing the sensor's ability to absorb x-ray photons is done at the expense of
				spatial resolution. In addition, the greatest possible image information must be extracted using the
				smallest possible exposure, i.e. the smallest possible number of photons. To extract all available image
				information, each x-ray photon which is absorbed by the screen must be made to independently contribute
				to the image. In other words, the information/exposure tradeoff is optimized in a detector which can
				detect individual x-ray photons. The finite number of quanta used to form an image has associated with
				it a limited ability to statistically resolve spatial detail and contrast. The sensor's sensitivity is
				optimized by causing it to absorb the maximum number of incident x-ray photons. For radiographic film,
				spatial resolution requirements directly limit the phosphor thickness which can be used. Since the PSF
				of the phosphor can be deconvolved from images acquired in a digital format, phosphor thickness is less
				constrained in digital radiography.</p>
			<p>The immediate objective in trying to develop a digital, medical radiography sensor must be to determine
				what information density is available in a typical medical radiograph and thus what sensor parameters
				must be met. The available exposure at the sensor is variable not only across the sensor but between
				different image acquisitions. For this work, the value of 500 μR is chosen to be representative of an
				average exposure at the sensor for an average medical radiograph. Assuming that only 40 keV photons are
				used, a photon fluence of 10.9x106 photons/cm2 is calculated to be incident at the image sensori. This
				photon density can carry an information equivalent between that of the light available outdoors at
				twilight and the light available under typical indoor room lightingii (based on certain photographic
				assumptions) .</p>
			<p>Consider a square region (pixel) in the image sensor whose side length is d. This region of the sensor
				intercepts an elemental area, d2, of the x-ray image field. This area is illuminated by an average
				number of photons, n, given by the average photon density calculated above and the size of the elemental
				area. Variations in the actual number of photons seen in a given elemental area provide the image
				information. However, the random nature of radiation generation and interactions, also creates
				variations in the actual number of photons absorbed in a pixel.</p>
			<p>The reason for choosing a small pixel size is to allow imaging of small object details or correspondingly
				to allow the imaging of high spatial frequency information. The pixel size must be chosen to be
				sufficiently small to see the smallest image detail which is available to it. However, there are
				performance trade-offs associated with making the pixels small and thus they must be made as large as
				the imaging process will allow.</p>
			<p>Suppose it is desired to visualize a minimally resolvable image detail. As the problem is outlined above,
				this image detail should occupy a single pixel. This image detail's photon density has a relative
				difference, C, with respect to the photon density of the surrounding area. C is the detail's contrast
				and it takes on values between zero and one. In order to tell an image detail from a statistical
				fluctuation, the photon density in the pixel must be statistically significantly different from the
				background photon density. High contrast details are easier to image than low contrast details and thus
				can be smaller and still be statistically significant. The real issue is the total differential number
				of photons stopped by the object detail. A high contrast image detail needs less area to stop a given
				number of photons. A large detail can be lower contrast and still stop a given number of photons. If the
				total photon density increases, lower contrast and smaller details can stop that same number of photons.
				This is represented in Equation 2-3 which is derived by Rose3.</p>

			<p>The square root is due to the Poisson nature of the process being considered. The five in the denominator
				on the right hand side dictates the reliability with which it is possible to visualize the image detail
				and refers to five standard deviations from the mean or a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of five. Though
				not an absolute number, Rose makes arguments for use of five as the threshold S/N for a minimally
				detectable image feature.</p>
			<p>If it is desired to resolve 128 shades of grey (a seven bit image) in a medical image made at an exposure
				of 500 μR then Equation 2-3 implies that the size of the minimally resolvable x-ray picture element has
				a side length of 194 μm i.e. the inherent resolution is 2.6 mm<sup>-1</sup>. Of course no phosphor is
				able to stop
				100% of the available photons and this loss of photons will lead to some loss of resolution at this
				level of contrast. If unity contrast (i.e. a black and white shadowgram) was all that was of interest, a
				statistically resolvable pixel size of 15 μm would be available (i.e. 33 mm<sup>-1</sup>). However,
				important
				details of this size are not common in the human body and where they do exist they have a much lower
				contrast than unity. It is recognized that some high contrast spatial resolution greater than 2.6
				mm<sup>-1</sup>
				may be desired. Therefore as a compromise, a geometric sensor resolution of 5 mm<sup>-1</sup> (i.e. a
				pixel size of
				100 μm) has been established for development of the sensor under consideration. </p>
			<h4>The Nyquist Criterion</h4>
			<p>The spatial version of the Nyquist criterion states that to avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency of a
				quantizer (and a digital sensor is a spatial quantizer) must be at least twice the spatial bandwidth of
				the signal. The arguments of the previous section show that image information at frequencies greater
				than 5 mm<sup>-1</sup> is not expected at the sensor and any input at such greater frequencies is noise.
			</p>
			<p>As in other quantizing systems, the digital radiography system being considered avoids aliasing though
				the use of low-pass filtering caused by the spread of light in the intensifying phosphor. An
				intensifying phosphor has an approximately Gaussian PSF. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a
				Gaussian an intensifying phosphor also has an approximately Gaussian MTF. It is thus a low-pass filter
				and attenuates image components with high spatial frequencies. In addition, sensitivity demands require
				that radiographic sensor be a quantizer of the averaging type and not of the sampling type (i.e. the
				pixels must integrate their signal over a significant area of the sensor). This introduces its own
				low-pass filtering effect by integrating signals of greater spatial frequency than 5 mm<sup>-1</sup>
				across the
				area of a sensor element.</p>
			<p>Based on the ability of the imaging process to resolve image details, a geometric resolution of 5
				mm<sup>-1</sup> is
				established. This means the sensor will have square pixels whose side lengths are 100 μm and which are
				set on 100 μm centers. Based on the arguments of the last section, no image information will be
				compromised by doing this. Based on the arguments of this section, no aliasing will result from it.</p>

				<h2>THE METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR (MOS) CAPACITOR</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>Device Structure</h3>
			<p>A MOS capacitor is formed when a layer of electrical conductor (the metal) is closely coupled to a thin
				layer of electrical dielectric (the oxide) which is in turn closely coupled to a thick layer of doped
				semiconductor (the semiconductor). Though actual dimensions differ significantly from device to device,
				a typical oxide thickness is approximately 500 Angstroms. Typical metal layer thicknesses are
				approximately 1 μm and typical semiconductor layer thicknesses are approximately 0.5 mm. Thick oxide
				regions are used to isolate MOS capacitors from each other and from the external environment.</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this discussion, the semiconductor is taken to be n-doped silicon. To extend this
				discussion to p-doped semiconductors, negative voltage and charge conventions must be adopted and the
				description is entirely analogous. For the purposes of this discussion, the oxide is taken to be silicon
				dioxide and the metal layer is taken to be p-doped polycrystalline silicon. Though it is silicon, the
				metal is called such because it is used as a good electrical conductor. A schematic diagram of a MOS
				capacitor is shown in Figure 3-1. The semiconductor layer is grounded and bias voltages which are
				applied refer to potentials on the metal layer gate.</p>

					<img style=" width:60%;" src="images/thesis/fig_3_1.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>Figure 3-1: Geometric Description of the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Capacitor</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>The Effect of Bias</h3>
			<p>The unbiased ideal MOS capacitor has no net charge in either the metal or the semiconductor. The oxide is
				assumed to have no free charge of either sign. To bias the MOS capacitor, the metal gate is connected to
				an external voltage (charge) source. The substrate is made of an n-doped semiconductor and the majority
				mobile charge carriers there are electrons.</p>
			<p>If an excess positive charge is placed on the metal gate of the capacitor, mobile electrons are attracted
				close to the oxide and the device functions like a conventional (metal-oxide-metal) capacitor. This mode
				of operation is known as accumulation and is not particularly useful for the present application. </p>
			<p>If a small excess negative charge is placed on the gate, mobile electrons in the substrate are repelled
				from the oxide and the region immediately underneath the gate becomes depleted of mobile electrons. For
				this reason, this region is called the depletion region. When these electrons are repelled, a net
				positive charge remains due to the ionized donor atoms in the silicon crystal lattice. For this reason,
				this region is also often called the space charged region (SCR). This fixed positive charge terminates
				the field lines of the negative charge stored in the metal layer and thus the device functions as a
				capacitor. As progressively greater bias voltages are applied to the gate, progressively larger
				depletion regions are formed. This mode of operation is also not very interesting for the present
				application.</p>
			<p>When the bias voltages exceeds a threshold value, the device enters the deep depletion/inversion mode of
				operation. This mode of operation is interesting for the application being considered. When the bias is
				first applied, a deep depletion layer (SCR) is formed whose depth is governed by the magnitude of the
				bias. This condition is known as deep depletion. If an electron hole pair (ehp) is created in the SCR,
				the electric lines of force which exist across the SCR will move the hole to the semiconductor/oxide
				interface just beneath the metal gate. If an ehp is created outside the SCR, it feels no electric force
				and its motion is thermal. If it wanders into the edge of the SCR, it will be collected as if it had
				been created in the SCR. This collection mechanism can create a hole gradient. This gradient leads to
				diffusion which can contribute to the collection of 4charges created outside the SCR. The relative
				importance of diffusion depends on the specific conditions being considered. The charges which thus
				accumulate under the gate form what is known as the inversion layer. As the inversion layer is formed
				the depth of the SCR shrinks until it reaches some final value. When the inversion layer is completely
				formed, the mode of operation is then known as inversion.</p>
			<p>The actual geometry of the SCR and the distribution of excess charge is difficult to calculate. However,
				a model which is often applied is called the delta depletion approximation. The delta depletion
				approximation implies that mobile charges which accumulate under the gate are uniformly distributed in
				the lateral dimensions but occupy no volume (i.e. a surface charge distribution). It also implies that
				excess fixed charges are uniformly distributed in a rectangular volume below the gate. In other words,
				there is no variation in charge density within the SCR, the SCR ends abruptly, and it does not extend
				beyond the edges of the metal gate. Clearly, this is this is an over-simplification but one which often
				leads to useful results.</p>
			<p>The reason that this mode of operation is important for the present application is that the device does
				not instantly reach equilibrium (i.e. there is a transient). Energy is required to create ehps and thus
				an MOS capacitor can be used to measure energy.</p>
			<h3>Thermal Generation</h3>
			<p>The energy necessary to create an ehp can come solely from the thermal energy of the crystal. In the
				absence of illumination, a biased capacitor will eventually decay from deep depletion to inversion due
				only to thermal generation. The thermal generation rate increases with the temperature of the device and
				decreases with the quality of the device (i.e. the absence of imperfections slows thermal generation).
				Thermal generation is modeled as having two components. The first component is generation in the SCR and
				this leads to a generation rate which is proportional to the volume of the SCR. The second component is
				due to generation outside the SCR with the semiconductor/oxide interface being the most important
				contributor. The other contributor to this component is charges which are generated outside the SCR but
				diffuse into the SCR. This component leads to a generation rate which is modeled as being independent of
				the volume of the SCR.</p>
			<h3>Photogeneration</h3>
			<p>The energy required to excite an electron across the bandgap yielding an ehp need not be thermal. If an
				optical photon whose energy is greater than the bandgap enters the MOS capacitor semiconductor, then it
				may give up its energy to create an ehp. Not every photon which impinges on a MOS capacitor produces an
				ehp. Note that in order to penetrate into the semiconductor, an incident photon must cross four
				interfaces all of which are partially reflective and it must pass through the overlying materials which
				are partially absorptive without being either absorbed or reflected. Once it reaches the semiconductor,
				it must then undergo a productive (ehp producing) interaction. If energy efficiency is the objective
				(i.e. the charge collected per unit energy incident is the important parameter), then low energy optical
				photons are more effective than are high energy optical photons. Unless the optical photon imparts
				enough energy to the charge carrier to cause secondary ionization, the photon energy beyond that
				required to create a single ehp is wasted. Photons which are energetic enough to create secondary
				ionization, are outside of the visible spectrum.</p>
			<p>As with thermal generation, once an ehp is created, in order to be detected, the mobile charge generated
				must reach the semiconductor/oxide interface beneath the gate and remain there until sensed without
				undergoing a destructive interaction (ehp recombination). The charge-producing interaction should not
				occur far from the edge of the depletion layer for the charges created by the photon which enters a MOS
				capacitor to be collected. Optical photons are assumed to be exponentially absorbed by silicon (i.e. the
				optical photon fluence is assumed to be proportional to the negative exponential of the depth into the
				silicon). The mean penetration depth of an optical photon in silicon is a function of its energy.
				Optical photons (400 to 800 nm wavelength) have a penetration depth between 0.4 μm (violet) and 11 μm
				(red). If long wavelength light is of interest, deep silicon penetration may become a concern. Therefore
				for a MOS capacitor to efficiently detect optical photons and to prevent created charges from being
				collected by other nearby MOS capacitors, the mean penetration depth (the reciprocal of the absorption
				coefficient) should not be large when compared to the depletion layer depth. Light doping and high bias
				voltages lead to deep depletion layers. If deep optical photon penetration becomes a concern, light
				doping and high bias may be called for in order to create a very deep depletion layer.</p>
			<h3>Ionization Due to Energetic Radiation</h3>
			<p>Optical photons are not the only radiation which can create ehp's in a semiconductor. Energetic charged
				particles (e.g. electrons, protons, and alpha particles) which pass through a semiconductor create ehps
				by exciting lattice electrons across the bandgap through direct Coulombic interactions. The high-energy
				quanta of interest (i.e. 40 keV photons) create energetic electrons by undergoing Compton scatter or
				photoelectric absorption either in the semiconductor or one of the overlying layers. The liberated
				electrons then pass through the semiconductor and create other ehps through Coulombic interactions. Each
				energetic photon creates a large number of ehps. Though some energy is lost due to incomplete energy
				transfer in Compton interactions and to a lesser degree due to escape of energetic charged particles,
				the number of ehps created due to a high energy photon increases with the energy of the incident photon.
				Therefore, the total charge generated is indicative of the incident energy fluence. Material interfaces
				do not reflect x-ray photons and MOS capacitors are made of low atomic number (Z) materials. Therefore
				an incident x-ray field is negligibly attenuated by overlying structures before reaching the sensitive
				semiconductor layer. However, since the sensitive semiconductor is also made of low Z materials, it
				presents a low cross section for interaction. Thus the incident x-ray field is also negligibly
				attenuated by the sensitive semiconductor layer. As an example, if a beam of 40 keV photons impinges on
				a 0.5 mm slab of silicon (a typical electronic silicon wafer thickness), 95% will pass through without
				any interaction. Higher energy photons will have an even smaller probability of interaction. When
				interactions occur, the initial charge distribution created is relatively uniform with depth in the
				semiconductor making the collection of generated charge less efficient.</p>

				<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
				<h2>THE MOS CAPACITOR AS A DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHIC SENSOR ELEMENT</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>Configuration and Operation</h3>
			<p>To perform digital radiography, an image sensor which can detect the presence of and variations in an
				x-ray field is required. When exposed to stimuli such as heat, light or ionizing radiation, the biased
				MOS capacitor responds by producing and collecting mobile charge carriers whose presence can be
				measured. The objective is to configure an array of MOS capacitors such that when it is exposed to an
				x-ray field each of the MOS capacitors collects a quantity of charge which is related in a meaningful
				way to the local intensity of the x-ray field.</p>
			<h4>Field Intensification</h4>
			<p>As discussed in Chapter 3, silicon is essentially transparent to high energy photons and as discussed in
				Chapter 2, a scintillating phosphor layer should be incorporated in the sensor element design to
				increase the sensitivity of the sensor. Light emitting phosphor screens are typically used in medical
				radiography and lead screens are typical in industrial radiography. Lead screens provide signal
				intensification by converting the energy of incident x-ray photons into energetic electrons through
				photoelectric interaction. Without a complete discussion, it is noted that MOS capacitors sustain
				permanent radiation damage from energetic electrons and the design of a system based around the MOS
				capacitor should not seek to increase the presence of such electrons. In addition, though lead screens
				have a smaller PSF, phosphor intensifying screens can provide a much larger gain. Therefore, lead is
				rejected for use with the MOS capacitor sensor element and it is proposed that a layer of light emitting
				phosphor (such as terbium activated gadolinium oxysulfide [Gd2O2S(Tb)] or thallium activated cesium
				iodide [CsI(Tl)]) be placed over the MOS capacitor to improve its sensitivity to x-rays. Though the
				phosphor PSF can be deconvolved from a digital image, the thickness of the phosphor layer will be
				somewhat driven by the resolution considerations presented in Chapter 2.</p>
			<h4>Signal Readout and Processing</h4>
			<p>The issue of how best to read the accumulated charge from the MOS capacitor is not addressed in this
				work. However, the following general principles are noted:</p>
			<p>1. To have sufficient resolution and sensitivity and not have large gaps in the imaging plane, the
				amplification, readout, digitization, and processing circuits cannot occupy the same silicon surface
				as the MOS capacitor sensor elements.</p>
			<p>2. To avoid significant problems with transmission line capacitance, readout circuitry should be
				co-planar with the imaging sensor array.</p>
			<p>One possible solution to these problems which has been proposed is to place the imaging plane and the
				readout plane on separate silicon slabs, facing each other, electrically connected by inter-plane metal
				contacts, and separated by the phosphor layer.</p>
			<p>It was noted above that electronic devices are sensitive to radiation damage from energetic electrons. In
				addition to reducing the exposure requirements of the sensor, the light emitting phosphor can also serve
				as a shield for electronic components. In the readout-circuits/phosphor/sensor-plane sandwich
				configuration which is proposed, the phosphor layer can only shield one plane of the sensor. Whether the
				sensor plane or the readout plane should be shielded must be determined by their relative
				radiosensitivity. Since the readout plane will likely have excess area and can use redundant circuits,
				it is probably this plane which should remain unshielded. Alternatively, it may be possible to read out
				the sensor plane from the rear in which case both the sensor and readout planes would be shielded.</p>
			<p>It has been proposed that some local gain be provided by putting a small amplifier in close contact with
				each sensor element. Whether or not this is incorporated into the final design, it is not possible to
				completely fill each pixel in the imaging plane with a MOS capacitor (i.e. a fill factor of 100% is
				unachievable). Some area will be lost in providing a port to bring charge out of the MOS capacitor and
				more area will likely be lost due to in-plane wiring. The fill factor will be driven by the achievable
				properties of the MOS capacitor and the constraints of the readout circuits. The maximum reasonably
				achievable fill factor is estimated to be approximately 75%.</p>
			<h4>Exposure Cycle</h4>
			<p>The exposure cycle of a MOS capacitor used in this manner is one of x-ray photon illumination, optical
				conversion, electronic conversion, collection, and readout. Incoming x-ray photons forming an x-ray
				image interact with the intensifying phosphor layer. Visible photons are emitted by the phosphor
				creating an optical image. Some photons penetrate the surface of MOS capacitors and produce ehps. Holes
				are collected under the MOS capacitor gates and remain there after the exposure is complete forming an
				electronic image (i.e. a pattern of stored electrons). After completion of the exposure, the readout
				circuitry removes the charge from under the gates of the MOS capacitors and, using charge sensitive
				amplifiers, converts the charge stored under each MOS capacitor into a voltage. Analog to digital
				converters (A/Ds) put these voltages into a digital format and this set of digital values is made
				available to a computer for processing and display.</p>
			<h4>The MOS capacitor Response</h4>
			<p>Based upon the discussion in Chapter 3, one possible way to try to think of the MOS capacitor is as a
				fluence detector for optical photons. In other words, the charge which accumulates under the gate is
				expected to be directly proportional to the number of optical photons which impinge on the MOS
				capacitor. The only deviation from this behavior which might be expected is a loss of sensitivity as the
				MOS capacitor accumulates charge and its depletion layer shrinks. The collected charge is the detector
				response. Based upon the same discussion, the MOS capacitor should function as an energy fluence
				detector to x-ray photons, i.e. the charge which accumulates is expected to reflect the total x-ray
				photon energy which is incident upon the MOS capacitor. In the configuration which is being considered,
				the dominant contribution to the MOS capacitor response is optical illumination. Thus the MOS
				capacitor's response to light is of prime concern. However, since the number of optical photons created
				is proportional to the energy of the incident x-ray photon, the phosphor serves as an x-ray energy
				fluence to optical photon fluence converter. Therefore, only the magnitude of the response changes. Its
				characteristic shape remains the same. Thus, in radiographic use, the sensor is expected to have a
				response which is a linear function of its x-ray energy fluence (exposure).</p>
			<p>If this is the case, the MOS capacitor will not be a logarithmic detector and therefore its H&D Curve
				will not be linear. If a linear relationship between response and optical path length is desired, the
				MOS capacitor's response signal must be filtered using histogram adjustment techniques. If not, it will
				better discriminate between optically thin regions than between optically thick regions. This is the
				effect seen when a sensor does not lose its sensitivity during an exposure as described in Chapter 2.
			</p>
			<h3>Expected System Performance</h3>
			<p>Since a sensor element configuration has been proposed, the next step is to evaluate its suitability.
				For clarity, the sensor element configuration description is repeated here. The sensor element is a
				square region which is 100 μm long on each side. It has an estimated fill factor of 75%, i.e. 75% of
				the available sensor element area is occupied by the sensitive area of a MOS capacitor. The average
				available exposure across all sensor elements is 500 μR (i.e. approximately 1100 x-ray photons are
				incident per pixel). The sensor is covered by a layer of scintillating material. The MOS capacitor
				has an efficiency, K, of converting optical photons incident upon its active surface into electrons
				under its gate. Effects due to variable photon entry angle are neglected.</p>
			<h4>The Phosphor Layer</h4>
			<p>Since the device being considered has not yet been made, it is not certain what type of phosphor
				performance will be achievable. However, for use in preliminary design and to evaluate feasibility,
				it is necessary to estimate the constraints which the sensor element will place on the readout
				circuits. For this reason, two possible phosphor configurations are considered. An actually
				achievable performance is expected to lie somewhere in between that predicted by the two considered
				scenarios and they will be treated as bounds for the actual sensor element phosphor capability. </p>
			<p>The low-end phosphor capability is based upon the specifications providedi for the Kodak Lanex -
				Regular Screen. Since phosphors deposited on a silicon wafer do no need to be as resistant to wear
				as a cassette screen, better performance is to be expected with an equivalent phosphor technology
				used in an electronic imaging system. Therefore, this description is taken as the low-end of
				possible capabilities for use with a MOS capacitor. The Kodak Lanex - Regular screen uses Gd2O2S(Tb)
				and La2O2S(Tb). The La2O2S(Tb) occupies only 7% of the mass of the screen and thus a simplifying
				assumption is made that the total phosphor mass is made up of Gd2O2S(Tb). The most important
				emission of Gd2O2S(Tb) is at 544 nm (2.27 eV)ii and the approximation is made that this is the only
				emission. The material is 18% efficient at converting absorbed energy to optical photons and the
				optical photons created have a 50% probability of escape from the phosphor. Given this description,
				each x-ray photon absorbed produces an average of 3168 optical photons. Of these, an average of 1584
				escape the phosphor. If the MOS capacitor has a fill factor of 75%, then an average of 1188 visible
				photons will reach the active sensor area. </p>
			<p>To maximize absorption without compromising spatial resolution, these screens are typically used in
				pairs with one on each side of the film. Only front illumination of the MOS capacitor is being
				addressed here. Back-illumination involves additional considerations. However, the issue at hand is
				estimating the number of optical photons and electrons which are created by a single x-ray photon.
				It has been noted that since its PSF can be deconvolved from an image, the phosphor's thickness is
				less of a constraint for the sensor being considered. However, optimization of x-ray photon
				absorption is an issue for later consideration.</p>
			<p>The high-end phosphor specification is based upon a technique developed by Phillips Medical Systems
				for growing high resolution arrays of scintillating waveguides from CsI(Tl). CsI(Tl) is essentially
				transparent to its own emissions. By using the ability of such an array to guide the light to the
				sensor a thick phosphor layer can be used without compromising PSF. If a reflecting surface is
				applied to the far end of the waveguide array, a very large transmission of generated light to the
				MOS capacitor is possible. The ideal case is assumed, with a 100% transmission of light. In
				addition, long waveguides can be grown which have a high absorption. Absorptions of 87% have been
				projected. The peak emission of CsI(Tl) is at 540 nmi (2.29 eV). This is assumed to be its only
				emission and within the constraints of this assumption, this is essentially the same as for
				Gd2O2S(Tb). For the purposes of making measurements, 540 nm will be assumed for each. CsI(Tl) has a
				conversion efficiency of 11.9%6. Given this, each incident x-ray photon which is absorbed will
				produce an average of 2079 optical photons. All are assumed to be guided to the MOS capacitor.
				Though waveguides shaped like a funnel with a non-uniform diameter may lead to fill factor
				enhancement, a fill factor of 75% is still assumed. Therefore, an average of 1559 optical photons
				per x-ray photon are incident on active sensor area.</p>
			<p>The high end phosphor performance represents a 31% improvement over the low end phosphor performance.
				This is relatively small. Assuming that the assumptions made are valid, this leads to a relatively
				small window for the required electronic performance. Therefore, the electronics can be developed
				somewhat independently of the phosphor. </p>
			<h4>MOS Capacitor Detector</h4>
			<p>As stated in Chapter 1, the MOS capacitor is the fundamental sensor element in the CCD. Expected
				quantum efficiencies for MOS capacitors are availablei in the context of their use in CCDs. When
				used to collect optical photons, the principle of charge collection is the same and only the method
				of readout separates the CCD from the proposed configuration. At the wavelength of interest (540
				nm), front-illuminated, polysilicon gate MOS capacitors are reported to have a quantum efficiency of
				approximately 44% when used in CCDs. MOS capacitors can be fabricated with gate materials which are
				less reflective and less absorptive than polysilicon. Front illuminated MOS capacitors with tin
				oxide gates are reported to have a quantum efficiency of approximately 74%. Back illuminated MOS
				capacitors are reported to have a quantum efficiency of approximately 72%.</p>
			<p>Since the MOSIS process is readily available for research activities and it uses a polysilicon gate,
				the 44% quantum efficiency associated with front-illuminated, polysilicon-gate MOS capacitors is of
				immediate interest. For a quantum efficiency of 44%, each incident x-ray photon gives rise to an
				average of between 523 and 686 stored electrons based on the bounds of expected phosphor
				performance. If this quantum efficiency is achieved, in order for the sensor element to be able to
				count x-ray photons, the readout electronics must be able to resolve charge packets of this
				approximate size. Actual performance of MOSIS MOS capacitors must be evaluated to verify this
				performance criterion.</p>

			<h2>AVAILABLE MATERIALS FOR DATA COLLECTION</h2>
			<p>To support research activities of this type, The Information Sciences Institute of the University of
				Southern California runs MOSIS. Fabrication of an integrated circuit requires a large overhead in
				equipment, personnel, and expertise. Moreover, the design of any integrated circuit is very dependent
				upon the specifics of the process used to fabricate the device. MOSIS serves as a link between users who
				wish to design integrated circuits and silicon foundries which can implement a given circuit design.
				MOSIS provides a set of generic specifications for IC fabrication and design rules for IC design. The
				MOSIS fabrication process is relatively inexpensive, readily available, and reasonably simple to use for
				circuit implementation. Therefore, there is an obvious motivation to try to use MOSIS to implement the
				type of radiography sensor under discussion. Even if the MOSIS process does not ideally lend itself to
				making this type of device, it is the only readily available process to investigate the specifics of
				developing a radiography sensor within the scope of this work. The properties of a MOS capacitor as well
				as other components manufactured with this process are of interest. </p>
			<p>A test array IC was designed and manufactured prior to the start of this research. This test array IC
				contains three transistor circuits which are not of interest to this work and four MOS capacitors which
				are. The IC was fabricated by Hewlett Packard using the MOSIS 3 μm process. The 3μm specification is a
				scaling parameter for the process which dictates the minimum manufacturable device size. Each MOS
				capacitor has a nominal side length of 330 μm leading to a nominal area of 10.89x10<sup>-8</sup>
				m<sup>2</sup>. Two of the MOS
				capacitors are n-type and two are p-type. Because of the large size of the MOS capacitors, the
				unavoidable length errors introduced in processing have a negligible effect on the MOS capacitor area.
				The connections to the gate and semiconductor layers of these MOS capacitors are made directly to the
				bond pads and thus the pins. The die (i.e. the silicon slab) is placed in the IC package in such a way
				that there is no material covering it and it is directly accessible for illumination. </p>
			<p>For ease of making measurements, a 28-pin IC socket into which the test IC can be installed is mounted
				onto a perforated circuit board which is in turn mounted on standoffs inside of a metal housing. A
				thermoelectric cooling device and thermocouple are connected in the box so that the IC temperature can
				be controlled and monitored. Leads for these components are brought out to the side of the box to a
				power strip. The pins of the IC socket are connected to eight BNC connectors which are mounted on the
				metal housing to provide contact from the MOS capacitors to a Keithley CV-590 CV Analyzer. The metal
				housing has five fixed sides and one removable side. The IC faces the removable side and this side
				remains in place for making measurements under non-illuminated conditions and it is removed for making
				measurements under illumination.</p>
			<p>Equipment which was used to measure the properties of the MOS capacitors include the following: 1. A
				Keithley CV-590 Capacitance Meter used under computer control to measure the capacitance of the test
				structure MOS capacitors as well as changes in capacitance with time and bias voltage. The box used to
				house the test IC adds a parasitic capacitance which must be subtracted as do any coaxial cables used to
				connect the box to the capacitance meter. 2. A McPherson 1/4 Meter Spectrometer was used to generate
				quasi-monochromatic light. 3. A Metrologic Photometer was used to measure the intensity of optical light
				fields which to illuminated the IC. The Photometer reads energy deposition rate across its surface in
				mW; its sensor area was measured to be approximately 9x10-5 m2. This value of area is used to convert
				its measurements to optical energy flux. This instrument has been calibrated to the principal emission
				of the HeNe laser (633 nm) and has a nominal uncertainty of 10% for other optical illuminations.</p>
			<p>A spreadsheet program (EXCEL) was used to perform mathematical operations on data sets and produce
				graphical representations. </p>

			<p>If a positive bias is applied, the MOS capacitor goes into accumulation. only its oxide capacitance is
				measured and no doping information is provided. If a negative bias is applied, a depletion layer is
				formed whose depth is W. As successively greater negative biases are applied to the MOS capacitor, W
				increases. In deep depletion greater negative biases lead to smaller deep depletion capacitances since
				this is analogous to separating the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The depletion layer depth
				depends only on the deep depletion capacitance. </p>
			<p>Equation 6-1 indicates that the doping level at the edge of the depletion layer is inversely proportional
				to the rate at which the capacitance changes with respect to bias voltage (in deep depletion). Suppose
				that a bias voltage, V is applied to the MOS capacitor. A deep depletion layer depth of W is formed and
				a deep depletion capacitance, C, can be measured. Now if the bias voltage is incrementally increased,
				the depletion layer depth must increase and the capacitance must decrease. If the capacitance decrease
				is large, this is because the increase in depletion layer depth is large. If a large increase in
				depletion layer depth was required to terminate the field lines of the gate charge, this must be because
				there is a scarcity of available charge to be moved. This condition is created by sparse doping i.e.
				small values of N. The converse is true for large values of N.</p>

			<p>The first term accounts for all generation processes which depend on the presence of a non-equilibrium
				depletion layer. It makes the approximation that on a per unit volume basis in the depletion layer, the
				rate of charge generation is independent of the excess depth of the depletion layer. The excess
				depletion layer is the value of its depth beyond the final (equilibrium) value. W is the depletion layer
				depth and Wf is the final value. The characteristic parameter which describes this component of charge
				generation for a given device is τ, the generation lifetime. When adjusted by the temperature of the
				device (through ni) and the depth of the depletion layer, the value of τ gives the average time required
				to thermally generate a charge in the SCR under a unit area of a MOS capacitor. The second term accounts
				for all generation processes which are independent of depletion layer depth. The primary contributor to
				this term is charge generation at the semiconductor/oxide interface and the characteristic parameter is
				s, the surface charge generation velocity. When adjusted for the temperature (through ni), the parameter
				s gives the rate at which charges are thermally created at the surface or outside the SCR and collected
				under the gate in a unit area of a MOS capacitor. These two parameters are indicators of the quality of
				the semiconductor material and device. A high quality device is practically free of defects and will
				generate thermal charge slowly. A high quality MOS capacitor will thus be characterized by a large
				generation time (τ) and a small surface generation velocity (s).</p>

			<h4>Total Charge Generation</h4>

			<p>If the MOS capacitor can be modeled as an ideal fluence detector for optical photons, then Equation 6-4
				describes the total charge generation rate. The first term describes thermal generation which is
				dependent on depletion layer depth, the second term describes thermal generation which is independent of
				depletion layer depth, and the third term describes photogeneration. The symbol ni, is the intrinsic
				carrier concentration in silicon at the temperature of interest and is tabulated as a function of
				temperaturei. K is the quantum efficiency for converting optical photons to electrons. If dQ/dt (rate of
				charge generation per unit area) can be calculated for a MOS capacitor while it is exposed to a known
				flux (ϕ), Equation 6-4 provides a means for calculating the quantum efficiency of the device including a
				correction for thermal generation.</p>

			<p>Note that thermal charge generation goes on despite optical illumination and if the objective is to
				measure optical photon fluence, then thermal generation is a source of additive error signal. If the MOS
				capacitor is an ideal fluence detector with negligible thermal generation, then a given photon flux will
				lead to a given rate of charge photogeneration per unit area with the ratio between the two being the
				conversion efficiency, K.</p>

			<h3>Measurement and Calculation of Charge Generation Properties</h3>

			<h4>Calculation of Charge from Capacitance</h4>

			<p>The relationship given in Equation 6-5 exists between charge generation rate and rate of change of
				capacitance.<sup>7</sup> As charges are generated and collected by the MOS capacitor, they terminate the
				field lines of the charge stored on the gate and the depletion layer shrinks. As this happens, the
				capacitance of the device increases. A derivation of this relationship will not be shown, however it is
				noted that it is a non-linear relationship and as the capacitance gets larger, larger rates of change of
				capacitance result from the same rate of photogeneration.</p>

			<p>This equation provides a means for calculating the inversion charge versus time transient from a
				capacitance versus time transient measured with the CV-590 capacitance meter. Since this operation
				involves an integration or summation, the charge versus time transient will be more noise free than the
				capacitance versus time data. If the charge generation rate transient is desires, Equation 6-5 can be
				discretized. This will of course amplify any noise present. If this presents a problem, a digital
				adjacent points filter can be used to suppress this noise. </p>

			<h4>The Zerbst Plot Method of Parameter Calculation</h4>

			<p>The Zerbst plot can be used to extract the two thermal generation parameters described above for a
				specific device. The Zerbst plot is a way of presenting the capacitance versus time transient of a MOS
				capacitor as it decays without illumination from deep depletion to inversion. The Zerbst plot is a graph
				of the negative time derivative of (Co/C)2 against (CF/C -1) where CF is the final (equilibrium)
				capacitance which the MOS capacitor achieves during the transient. The ordinate of the Zerbst plot is
				proportional to the rate of thermal charge generation and the abscissa is proportional the depletion
				layer depth. Assuming the linear model of charge generation, the Zerbst plot is linear. In practice the
				model ceases to hold as the depletion layer approaches its equilibrium depth but is generally relatively
				linear for large values of the abscissa. If the linear part of the graph is extrapolated back to the
				ordinate, then τ is inversely proportional to the slope and s is directly proportional to the intercept.

			<p>A MOS capacitor's depletion layer depth can be calculated from its capacitance. Assuming the linear model
				of charge generation, Zerbst plot data can be used to calculate dQ/dt as a function of time and thus
				charge as a function of time. However, it is shown in Equation 6-8 that there is a more direct method of
				calculating charge versus time which does not depend on the validity of the linear model. For this
				reason, the Zerbst plot should not be used for this purpose but should only be used to extract the two
				parameters which are commonly used to describe the thermal generation properties (and hence quality) of
				a MOS capacitor and the semiconductor it is built on.</p>

			<h4>Test of Validity for Charge Generation Model</h4>

			<p>It is desirable to test the validity of the charge generation model (Equation 6-4) for a MOS capacitor
				under optical illumination. Since it is possible to measure the capacitance versus time transient of a
				MOS capacitor under optical illumination and it is possible to calculate the charge versus time
				transient from this data (Equation 6-7), it should be possible to substitute measurable variables
				(Equation 6-2) into the charge generation model and verify that it yields an expression which accurately
				describes a measured capacitance versus time transient. If measurable variables are substituted into
				this equation, then the expression in Equation 6-11 results. This can be discretized in the manner of
				Equation 6-8 to use data sets acquired with the capacitance meter.</p>

			<p>One way to test the validity of the charge generation model is to measure a capacitance versus time
				transient, perform the operation defined by the right hand side of Equation 6-11, and verify that it is

				versus time transient measured while under a known illumination to calculate the quantum efficiency of a

				<h2>CHARACTERIZATION OF A TEST STRUCTURE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</h2>

				<h3>Doping Profile Calculations</h3>

				<p>To calculate the doping profiles for the MOS capacitors in the test structure IC, deep depletion
					capacitance versus voltage curves were required. A single n-type and a single p-type MOS capacitor
					were
					chosen for investigation. The properties measured for these two MOS capacitors are taken as
					representative of properties to be expected from MOSIS MOS capacitors in general.</p>
				<p>Deep depletion capacitance versus voltage measurements were made for these two MOS capacitors and
					doping
					profiles were calculated from this data using Equations 6-1 and 6-2. The deep depletion capacitance
					versus voltage response for the n-type MOS capacitor is presented in Figure 7-1. The response for
					the
					p-type MOS capacitor is presented in Figure 7-2. The doping profiles are presented in Figures 7-3
					and
					7-4.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Figures 7-3 and 7-4 present calculated doping profiles for bias voltages between 0 and 8 volts. This
					technique for calculating doping profiles becomes unreliable at very small bias voltages. Small bias
					voltages correspond to small depletion layers. Therefore, these profiles are not valid at small
					silicon
					depths. </p>

					<figcaption>Figure 7-4: Dopant Concentration versus Depth into P-Doped Silicon Well</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>The following are expected results. First, the p-well is more heavily doped than the substrate. This
					is
					typical for a p-well CMOS process. Second, for the same bias potential, the p-well does not develop
					as
					deep a depletion layer as does the substrate. Since the p-well is more heavily doped, at a given
					bias
					the depletion layer does not need to be as deep to move the same quantity of charge away from the
					gate.
				</p>
				<p>The following are unexpected results. First, the measured dopant concentrations deviate significantly
					from the nominal values provided by MOSIS. MOSIS specifies the p-well doping to be
					7.4x10<sup>15</sup>
					cm<sup>-3</sup> and the
					substrate doping to be 7.6x10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>. These values are only intended for use
					as
					fitting parameters to be
					used in MOS transistor simulation. They are not intended to be actual values and failure to measure
					these values is not a source of concern. Second, the substrate is expected to be uniformly doped and
					the
					measurements indicate that it is not. The p-well is doped by ion implantation and thermal diffusion.
					Thus, p-well doping levels are not expected to be constant. The calculated doping indicates that its
					doping is relatively uniform. Even disregarding the very shallow data points, both profiles appear
					to
					show some buildup (retrograde doping) with depth and the p-well doping is more uniform than the
					substrate.</p>
				<p>Since the calculated values of doping appear to approach an asymptotic value for relatively large
					values
					of W, these asymptotic values are taken as being the meaningful values. This approximation is
					conservative since it will overestimate the thermal generation parameters. When these parameters are
					used to compensate quantum efficiency measurements, it will cause the quantum efficiency to be
					underestimated. These values were graphically measured from figures 7-3 and 7-4. The doping level
					(N) of
					the substrate is -1.50x1016 cm-3 and the doping level of the p-well is +2.45x10<sup>16</sup>
					cm<sup>-3</sup>. The sign of the
					doping level implies the sign of the charge carriers contributed by the dopant atom.</p>
				<p>The difference in doping concentrations and thus achievable depletion layer depth establishes a
					tentative
					precedence between the n-type and p-type MOS capacitors for use as a sensor element. The mean
					penetration depth of 540 nm photons in silicon is somewhere between 1 and 2 μm<sup>9</sup> and
					photon
					flux
					decreases exponentially with depth. Since the deep depletion layers formed had depths of up to 1 μm,
					maximizing depletion layer depth is expected to be a significant issue for good quantum efficiency.
					Since the n-type MOS capacitor is able to form deeper depletion layers, it is tentatively the
					preferred
					sensor element. Additionally, charge carriers have greater mobility in more lightly doped
					materials<sup>8</sup>
					making them easier to collect. This is also a factor in favor of the n-type MOS capacitor. As a
					preparation for the possibility that thermal generation becomes the limiting factor in device
					performance, the thermal generation properties of both MOS capacitor types will be evaluated.
					However,
					since quantum efficiency is expected to be the limiting factor and is certainly the most crucial
					factor,
					it will only be measured for the n-type MOS capacitor.</p>

				<h3>Zerbst Plot Calculation</h3>

				<p>To create Zerbst plots for these MOS capacitors, capacitance versus time transients were measured at
					room
					temperature (80˚ F) while the IC was shielded from illumination. No correction was made for the
					parasitic capacitance of the IC package and on-chip wiring but these effects should be negligible.
					These
					data are plotted in Figures 7-5 and 7-6. From these data, Zerbst plots are calculated for the MOS
					capacitors as described in chapter 6 and these plots are presented in Figures 7-7 and 7-8. The slope
					and
					intercept were graphically measured from these plots for use in calculating material parameters.</p>

				<p>From the deep depletion capacitance versus voltage response (Figure 7-1), the oxide capacitance (Co)

				<p>The capacitance versus time transient measurement for the p-type MOS capacitor is not complete.
					Instrument problems prevented acquisition and storage of data for much longer than two hours and
					therefore only partial data was collected. Once again, a transient of this length indicates a device
					of
					very high quality. As can be seen in Figure 7-8, the Zerbst plot calculated from this incomplete
					data
					set is also incomplete. It appears in this graph that a very smooth curve is being traced out with
					intermittent spikes in the positive and negative directions. These fluctuations are probably caused
					by
					the uncertainty of the last significant figure of the measurement of the capacitance by the CV-590
					meter. The best fit line to this graph has a negative intercept. This is inconsistent with the
					thermal
					generation model. Closer scrutiny of this graph shows that it is nonlinear and has a positive second
					derivative. To evaluate the material parameters, an intercept of zero is assumed and the slope was
					measured graphically by connecting a straight line between the origin and the approximate centroid
					of
					the available graph. This introduces significant error but it is clear that the linear model of
					thermal
					generation is only a crude approximation for this device. The results obtained using this method
					are:

				<p>From the deep depletion capacitance versus voltage response, Co was measured to be
					8.2x10<sup>-11</sup>
					F. Using the
					oxide thickness provided by MOSIS, the expected oxide capacitance is 8.6x10<sup>-11</sup> F. The
					value
					of CF was
					not measured from the dark capacitance versus time transient because the complete transient was not
					measured. However, the equilibrium capacitance values of this MOS capacitor were measured at
					voltages
					near the bias used for this measurement (8 V). This was done by pulsing the MOS capacitor with
					light,
					waiting 30 seconds for it to recover, and then measuring capacitance. For biases near 8 V, the
					equilibrium capacitance was measured to be approximately 3.3x10<sup>-11</sup> F. For biases in this
					range, the
					final capacitance is not sensitively dependent on bias and can be measured reliably. Therefore this
					value is taken to be the value of CF. From these values, the thermal charge generation parameters
					were
					calculated and are:</p>

				<p>Because the transient time of the p-type MOS capacitor is so long, considerations otherwise ignored
					might
					be important (e.g. extremely low level light leakage, temperature fluctuations, and background
					radiation
					levels). In addition, complete Zerbst plot data is not available and non-linearities are apparent.
					It
					can be said with certainty that thermal generation in the p-well is very slow and is significantly
					slower than in the substrate. Since thermal generation is a source of error signal in the system
					under
					consideration, this is a factor in favor of the p-type MOS capacitor. As described in Equation 6-11,
					these parameters can be used to correct quantum efficiency calculations for either of these MOS
					capacitors. Since the values of these parameters are very small, under normal circumstances, thermal
					generation is likely to represent only very small contributions.</p>

				<h3>Measured Latitude</h3>

				<p>Equation 6-8 was used to convert the thermal capacitance versus time transient of Figure 7-1 into a
					charge versus time transient which is shown in Figure 7-9. It can be seen in Figure 7-9 that at
					equilibrium at 8 V, this MOS capacitor can hold a charge of approximately 6.8x10<sup>-10</sup> C.
					The
					shape of the
					MOS capacitor is square with a side length of 330 μm. If a fill factor of 75% were achieved at 5
					mm<sup>-1</sup>
					resolution then this charge would be scaled (assuming it can be linearly scaled) to
					4.7x10<sup>-11</sup>
					C. Using
					the assumptions for high end performance discussed in Chapter 4, a captured x-ray photon gives rise
					to
					1559 optical photons which are incident on active sensor area. From Chapter 2, an average of
					10.9x106
					x-ray photons are incident per square cm. This implies 818 x-ray photons incident in a 100 μm sensor
					element. If all of these are captured and converted to useful light and if the MOS capacitor has a
					100%
					quantum efficiency for optical photons, then 1.3x106 charges will be created. This corresponds to
					2.0x10<sup>-13</sup> C or less than 0.03% of the available latitude of the device. In other words
					the
					device is
					able to sense a much stronger illumination than is required. Available latitude does not limit the
					feasibility of the device being considered.</p>

				<h3>Quantum Efficiency at 540 nm</h3>

				<p>As already described, the principal optical photon being considered has a wavelength of 540 nm. Using
					the
					tungsten filament source and spectrometer, the MOS capacitor was illuminated with light of
					wavelength
					540 nm at an intensity of 0.033 W/m2. This corresponds to a photon flux of 9.07x1016 m-2s-1. To
					protect
					the MOS capacitors on the IC, a thin glass cover slip was placed over the IC package opening. The
					air to
					glass interface seen by the incident field represents a reflectance in the system. A typical
					reflectance
					value for this type of interface in this range of wavelengths is approximately 8%i and thus the
					photon
					flux at the MOS capacitor surface is determined to be 8.35x10<sup>16</sup>
					m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.
					The capacitance versus time
					transient was measured under this illumination and is shown in Figure 7-10. The time dependence of
					the
					quantum conversion efficiency was calculated using Equation 6-11 and is shown in Figure 7-11. This
					curve
					is relatively flat across most of its range and the value of quantum conversion efficiency for the
					early
					part of the range is measured to be 7%. </p>
				<p>Note that the ripples seen in this graph are not due to the random uncertainty of individual data
					points.
					The fluctuations are periodic and have a frequency of approximately 1 Hz. The light source used for
					this
					measurement was a slide projector. Since the bulb was operated at a high power, a cooling fan was
					used.
					Since the MOS capacitor was not shielded against electromagnetic interference, this periodic noise
					was
					likely caused by the cooling fan. However, the oscillations are centered around 7% quantum
					efficiency.
					Note also, that toward the end of the measurement, the model is invalid, and the calculated quantum
					efficiency becomes very large.</p>

			<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
			<h2>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>The sensor which has been discussed is that of an array of MOSIS MOS capacitors, set on 100 μm centers,
				with a 75% fill factor. A plane of readout circuits faces the sensor array and a phosphor is sandwiched
				between them. The phosphor's properties lie somewhere between those of the Kodak Lanex - Regular screen
				and an idealized CsI(Tl) needle array. To perform in medical radiography, the objective is to resolve 40
				keV photons. Based upon the discussion in Chapter 4, each absorbed 40 keV photon is expected to give
				rise to between 1188 and 1559 optical photons. In Chapter 7, a quantum efficiency of 7% was measured for
				a test structure MOS capacitor. Using this device, between 83 and 109 electrons could thus be expected
				from each x-ray photon. This represents an extremely small charge and resolution of a charge of this
				size will require amplifiers of extremely high quality. It is unlikely that such amplifiers can be
				implemented in the space constraints of this sensor.</p>

			<h3>Disparity Between Measured and Tabulated Quantum Efficiencies</h3>

			<h4>Optical Quantum Efficiency</h4>

			<p>As discussed in Chapter 4, at the wavelength of interest a quantum efficiency of approximately 44% is
				expected for polysilicon gate MOS capacitors yet only a 7% quantum efficiency was measured for the test
				structure MOS capacitor. To keep capacitance measurements relatively noise-free, the test structure MOS
				capacitor was made with very large dimensions. The large capacitance value reduces uncertainties in its
				measurement. The gate of the MOS capacitor is made of polysilicon which is quite reflective and
				absorptive to optical photons. The gate is surrounded by relatively transparent silicon dioxide. In
				disagreement with the delta depletion approximation, the depletion layer does extend laterally beyond
				the edge of the gate. In addition, lateral diffusion can cause ehps to be detected which were not
				created in the shadow of the gate (which can lead to a deterioration of MTF). Therefore, a very
				sensitive sensor region is expected to exist around the edge of the MOS capacitor. Small squares or
				rectangles have more perimeter per unit area than do large ones and thus are expected to be more
				sensitive. The test structure MOS capacitors used have approximately 1000 times the area of typical CCD
				MOS capacitors and approximately 15 times the area of the projected sensor element MOS capacitor.</p>

			<h4>Response Function</h4>

			<p>As described in Chapters 3 and 4, good MOS capacitor quantum efficiency is expected to depend upon
				optical energy being deposited in or near the depletion layer and the only expected deviation from an
				ideal fluence detector model is some loss of sensitivity during an exposure cycle. The mean penetration
				depth of 540 nm photons is comparable to the maximum depletion layer depth of the n-type MOS capacitor
				at a bias of 8 V. The mean penetration depth is between 1 and 2 μm. Since no optically diffusing
				materials were placed between the light source and the sensor and the light source was located far from
				the sensor, normal incidence of photons is assumed and thus no off-axis adjustments are needed. Using
				Figure 7-5 and Equation 6-2, the initial and final depletion layer depths can be calculated for an
				optical exposure cycle. During an exposure, the depletion layer depth decreases from 0.93 μm to 0.30 μm
				so a significant portion of the photon energy is deposited beyond the depletion layer. If the depletion
				layer is the only sensitive region and diffusion is not an important effect, the sensitive volume is
				seen to decrease by a factor of three during a charging cycle and the sensitivity should decrease by a
				factor of three. However, this is not observed in Figure 7-11. The quantum efficiency remains
				essentially constant. This implies that diffusion is an important process in detection and that the same
				portion of generated carriers reach the depletion region independent of its depth. Essentially, carriers
				are able to diffuse at least one or two μm after generation to be detected. Part of the justification
				for neglecting p-type MOS capacitor is that n-type capacitors are able to form deeper depletion layers.
				Since quantum efficiency has been shown to not be sensitively dependent on depletion layer depth, this
				issue should be re-evaluated. </p>

			<h3>Methods of Improving Optical Quantum Efficiency</h3>

			<h4>Inherent Differences</h4>

			<p>Based on the arguments of the last section, the quantum efficiency of a MOS capacitor of the proposed
				size may be better than the calculations of Chapter 7 indicate. This is due to an enhanced perimeter
				effect for smaller MOS capacitors. In addition, the proposed geometry includes a close-coupling of a
				phosphor layer with a MOS capacitor. The measured quantum efficiency was for optical photons incident
				from air. If the photons enter the MOS capacitor from a phosphor layer, a smaller reflectance will be
				created due to a closer matching of the refractive index of these contacting layers. This would also
				improve the quantum efficiency of the proposed system.</p>
			<p>The measurement was made with a relatively planar beam whereas a close-coupled phosphor will create a
				light field which is non-planar. Optical photons which strike an interface at non-normal incidence are
				more likely to be reflected thus creating an apparent reduction in quantum efficiency. However if a
				CsI(Tl) needle structure (effectively a waveguide array) can be used, a generally forward direction of
				optical photon travel can be retained and this consideration will be minimized.</p>

			<h4>Design Variations</h4>

			<p>As described in Chapter 4, use of a transparent gate material such a tin oxide can significantly increase
				the quantum efficiency of a MOS capacitor. In general, prudent choice of MOS capacitor layer materials
				and thicknesses can function as an anti-reflective coating and lead to decreased reflectance causing an
				increased quantum efficiencyi. In the absence of transparent gate materials, windows can be created in
				the poly gate layer through which light can pass thus improving the quantum efficiency11. Diffusion
				seems to be an important process in the detection of charge carriers. For this reason, it may be
				possible to place large windows in a sensor element without any significant loss of collection
				efficiency. </p>
			<p>Another test structure IC containing MOS capacitors has been fabricated. It has not been completely
				characterized. When illuminated by white light, however, a square MOS capacitor whose side length is 25
				μm takes significantly less time to equilibrate at than does one whose side length is 330 μm. Assuming a
				capacitive charge storage ability which is normalized to area, a smaller time to equilibrate under a
				constant illumination implies a greater quantum efficiency. In addition, two test structure MOS
				capacitors (each a 100 μm square) were fabricated on the IC. The only difference in their structure is
				that the polysilicon gate of one has an array of perforations (filled with transparent thick silicon
				dioxide) across its surface. This MOS capacitor is referred to as a fishnet capacitor. When exposed to
				white light, the fishnet capacitor equilibrates much more rapidly than does its unperforated
				counterpart. This implies that such a design might be used to optimize the quantum efficiency of a MOS
				capacitor sensor element. </p>

			<h3>Further Suggested Work</h3>

			<h4>Investigating Thermal Generation</h4>

			<p>Thermal generation is a source of signal error for the proposed system. Though thermal generation was
				very slow for the test structure IC, it was still present. In addition, its contribution is expected to
				increase1 with accumulated dose. Thermal generation's contribution can be removed by subtracting an
				unilluminated exposure from an acquired image. Some attempt should be made to evaluate thermal
				generation in the context of image noise to determine how significant its contribution is, how much is
				acceptable, how it can best be minimized. In addition, the effect of sensor element geometry on thermal
				generation should be evaluated.</p>

			<h4>Modeling and Simulating</h4>

			<p>How a MOS capacitor is designed and operated impacts the depletion layer (sensor) it forms. Different
				types of phosphor layers will interact differently with different MOS capacitor designs. A CsI(Tl)
				needle array will create a different type of optical field than a layer of Gd2O2S(Tb) which is suspended
				in a lucite matrix and laid over the MOS capacitor. It would be desirable to model and simulate the
				detection process of the MOS capacitor/phosphor system to determine how to build the optimal sensor
				element. It would be ideal to model the entire image sensing process: x-ray transport in the phosphor
				and MOS capacitor, light transport in the phosphor and into the MOS capacitor, charge generation, charge
				transport, and charge collection. In addition to the varying reflectance across the surface of the MOS
				capacitor, the actual (non-idealized) geometry of the depletion layer must be considered as well as the
				diffusion properties of the silicon wafer and the effect of substrate contacts. To evaluate the
				properties of the MOS capacitors fabricated with a given process, an isolated MOS capacitor on a wafer
				can be pulse illuminated by a highly focused laser and the resulting charge generation measured. If this
				is repeated as a function of position over the MOS capacitor and the wafer and, it is anticipated that
				the diffusion properties can be determined from these measurements. This information can then be used
				for modeling and simulation. If work is to continue on development of the MOS capacitor for use in
				digital radiography, careful modeling of its optical and electrical properties is the most important
				next step. </p>
