            <div class="card-body">
                <p>I was a little sad to hear that Big Berta goes to the chop-shop this weekend. She
                    was number 3 of the 5 accelerators I had the pleasure of putting into service before retiring. Not
                    one of them was “vanilla”, which suits me fine.</p>
                <p>In reverse order:</p>
                <p>(5) Tomo-HDA, the “Ring of Fire”: Awaiting arrival, my old preceptor told me “you really f—d up
                    buying that, you’re going to hate it”. I’m sure that had been his experience, but Phil (RIP)
                    couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s still the best machine in the state.</p>
                <p>(4) iX: lowest linac energy in the state, built it for the breasts, but was also impressive for the
                    brains. I heard they bought the same at Vandy the next year.</p>
                <p>(3) EX, “Big Bertha”: highest energy in the state, and state of the art at the time, home of a number
                    of “firsts”, in the state and beyond. First (broad-beam) IMRT in the state, first respiratory
                    management, and first IGRT. First conformal arc-based IMRT in the US. The old girl has much to be
                    proud of. I'd suggest a viking funeral, if I thought it was in any way legal.</p>
                <p>(2) 2100C/S, the “Clinac in a Closet”: “S” stood for “special” or “semi-neutered”, depending on who
                    you asked, LO-X only and barely enough room to turn around, may have been the first MLC in the
                    Metroplex, though it maybe shouldn’t have been.</p>
                <p>(1) SL-18, some called it a “super lemon”, though we didn’t at the time, the Doc dropped in at the
                    Crowley factory one day and bought it while home visiting kin in the old country, which must have
                    been a hoot for all involved. The couch would get quite radioactive. Like a foreign sports car, it
                    could be fun to drive, but could also be quite quirky. The clinic launched in a hail of lawsuits,
                    and I nearly got washed down the Sacramento during commissioning, but we gave great care.</p>
