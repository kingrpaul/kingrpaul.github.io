                <p>It was okay. It was not terrible, but it certainly was not great. The miniseries was probably better.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the casting was poor, but Isaac and Ferguson did well. It's usually a shame for a movie maker
                    to exchange an author's vision for their neighbor's expectations & sensibilities This keeps
                    happening.</p>
                <p>It doesn't help when he or she tells the audience how to interpret the story's ending just after
                    the opening credits have finished. A well-told story leaves the viewer the pleasure of figuring that
                    our for him
                    or herself.</p>
                <p>Having read the book tends to ruin a mediocre movie, even if it was only the first volume and a long
                    time ago.
                </p>
                <p>This is the second reboot of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert">Frank
                        Herbert's</a> novel. Maybe it would be better to stick to rebooting botched things, things
                    you're sure you
                    can improve on.</p>
