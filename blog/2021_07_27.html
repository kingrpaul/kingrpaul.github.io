        <p>A modest proposal from a native-son living as an expatriate, here in a far-off, exotic land. </p>
        <p>The more stylish cities here, in the Magnolia State like to announce themselves with an eye-catching and artistic sign. I know that’s a real challenge  for Jacksonville, the Bold New City of the South, whose city-limits signs are not very visible, being located in Macclenny, Greene Cove Springs, and the bank of the St. Marys River (north or south bank, I’m not sure). </p>
        <p>I understand that you need a solution, but I hear the shiny-lerp solution is proving controversial. </p>
        <p>My own city boldly announces itself as a “Certified Retirement Community” which roughly translates as “if you don’t have a job, don’t expect to find one”.  Not sure what that certification process looks like, but suspect it probably involves writing a check. </p>
        <p>In some of the more stylish cities though; like Scooba, Shubuta, Macon, and even Forrest, the city takes a topiary approach, spelling out its name with shrubbery visible from the road. There’s hardly ever a spelling error and it looks pretty nice. </p>
        <p>For a mere $726,453 I can bring this contemporary and eco-friendly technique back to the ancestral homeland. That will be a huge savings over your other proposals. That only covers the 3 letters, but for that price I will provide not only the shrubs and fertilizer, but will even come by and water it monthly for the first year. </p>
