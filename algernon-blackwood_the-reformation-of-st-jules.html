<p>Foreigners ‚Äî they're all
mad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the English?</p>
<p>&quot;Mad as hatters!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Germans too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course‚ÄîJew mad!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what about the French?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well‚ÄîI guess I used to think
them a pretty sane crowd till I
came across the St. Jooles affair.
After that I saw that they were
as mad as all the rest‚Äîa bit more,
even!&quot;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It was the fat man in the corner
of the Smoking Room on
Deck A who was talking. Why, I
asked myself, is there always a fat
man in the corner of the Smoking
Room on board these liners? I
don't know, but there always is.</p>
<p>We were three days out from
Southampton on the Borotania.
Our particular Fat Man sat in
his corner, a huge cigar stuck
between his thick lips, and surrounded
by a crew of satellites for
whom he bought drinks at frequent
intervals, provided they
would listen to his stories. They
did. I am bound to admit that
he was an amusing fat man, and
evidently rich. His crowd stuck
to him like leeches. I myself constantly
took a seat just outside
the sacred circle on purpose to
listen to his stories, which grew
more and more racy as the evening
progressed.</p>
<p>On this particular night he was
at the top of his form; I could
tell by the way he twirled the big
cigar and by the flush on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell us about St. Jules,&quot; suggested
one of the crowd.</p>
<p>The fat man glanced round to
see if the circle was worth while,
Apparently it was. He blew out
a thick cloud of smoke, ordered
a round of drinks, smacked his
lips, and started.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he began confidentially,
as the way is with good storytellers,
&quot;I guess some of you
boys know the little burg as it is
now, but, believe me, three years
ago it was some town. Folks talk
a lot about Monte, but in those
days St. Jooles sure had it beaten
to a frazzle. The play at Monte
was pretty high, I know, but at
St. Jooles it was too high to see
the top. And the town was wide
open from dark to dawn.</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm telling you‚Äîthey
were a hard-boiled lot when I
first hit the town. Everything
was going full blast and a bit over.
I went to the old Continental
Hotel where I always stayed, and
the very first person I ran into
after checking in was Mossy Mason.
And I was sure glad to see old
Mossy. Mossy had been my sidekick
in a good many deals when
we were together back in god's
country. We liquored up.</p>
<p>&quot;After a bit, he took me aside
to a quiet spot outside on the
verandah.</p>
<p>&quot;'Tommy', he says, 'you're
just in time, but not a minute to
spare.'</p>
<p>&quot;'And the rest, Mossy?' I
enquires.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;It's like this,' he says, 'I've
got a real good thing, and you
must come in with me.' And he
gives me the quick once-over.</p>
<p>&quot;'Mossy,' I told him right
away, 'I don't want any of your
sure-fire-systems-to-beat-the-bank.
I have had some and, believe me,
I have had a plenty.'</p>
<p>&quot;I'm with you,' he explains.
'But this is the real thing.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Get on with it, then,' from
me.</p>
<p>&quot;'I've got a wop,' he goes on,
'with an advertising stunt that
will bring in the mazurka every
time.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Let's have the low-down,' I
asks.</p>
<p>&quot;'This is the way of it,' he
tells me then. 'The wop has
invented a machine that'll throw
letters on the sky over a mile long.
Bright as god's own fire they are.
And they'll knock out all the
electric signs that were ever made.
They just shake the guts out of
you with terror.'</p>
<p>&quot;'Now, see here,' I says.
'That's an old stunt. Folks have
been trying to do that since Nero
played the fiddle, and nothing ever
came of it.'</p>
<p>&quot;'The scale was too small,' he
explains. 'That was the trouble.
Now, to-morrow night we 're going
back into the hills with a lorry,
he and I, and, believe me, we're
going to show this town something
it's never seen before.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well, his stuff impressed me
some, and I asked what was he
going to do it with, this great
inventor-wop?</p>
<p>&quot;'A new sort of ray,&quot; he tells me.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it over a bit,
but I wanted to see the goods
before going in with him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's O.K. with me,' I says
finally, for I always make my mind
up quick, 'but I got to see it first.'</p>
<p>&quot;He looks me over. 'That's the stuff,'
he says. 'I never knew you miss a real
chance. You be down,' he goes on, 'on the
terrace here to-morrow night,' he says, 'and
we ll show you.'</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Well, it was after he left me that I
bumped into as nice a strawberry
blonde as you 'll find, and she sure kept me
amused the rest of the evening‚Äîonly that
is another story, as they say.</p>
<p>&quot;And next day Mossy introduced me to
his wop. He was a clever-looking guy called
Cavallo. He was full of his invention, and,
like all inventors, was soon talking in millions
of francs. It's a way they have, you know.
They could never invent anything unless
they were half-batty to start with. Still,
he made me feel there was something in it.
He tried hard to explain the thing to me
but it was too technical and I couldn't get
it. Never mind, I told him. 'You show it
to me to-night and it will be O.K. with me.'
And he said 'Benissimo' or 'spaghetti,' or
something like that, drank up his mineral
water, and made off.</p>
<p>&quot;And about ten o'clock that night, sure
enough, a lorry came along loaded with
machinery of sorts, and Mossy and Cavallo
climbs in. They told me they aimed to get
well away into the back country, so that no
one could see them doing their stuff. It was
a hell of an ascent, all hairpin bends right up
to the top of the mountain, and Cavallo
turns to me just as they push off. 'I'm
going to give this town the scare of its life,'
he says. They need it.</p>
<p>&quot;'That's all right with me,' I says.
'They do. Scare hell out of them if you
can.'</p>
<p>&quot;'I do that,' he replies‚Äîand they push off.</p>
<p>&quot;I got two hours to fill in, so I go look
for my blonde, and we fill in time at the
Casino. I run into a streak of luck and the
time passes very quickly. So I drag my
blonde out of the rooms about a quarter of
twelve and we sit on the terrace. We did
not know it then, of course, but that was the
very last night the Casino was open. Naturally,
I didn't say a word about the show I
was expecting from the mountains, but as
the minutes slipped by I began to get a
bit anxious.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fat Man stopped and yelled to the
steward to bring more drinks all round. And
it was while he was doing this that I noticed,
sitting in my corner, that a dark, foreign-looking
fellow with a black beard had slipped
into the chair beside me. He was obviously
French, judging by the Maryland cigarette
he was smoking with pleasure. Obviously,
too, he had been listening to Fatty's story
and was very much amused by what he
heard.</p>
<p>The steward having served the drinks,
Fatty took a couple of good-sized gulps and
went on with his yarn:</p>
<p>&quot;Where was I, boys? Oh, yes; I had the
blonde parked on the terrace. Well, I'm
telling you I had a job to keep her there.
She tried all the time to sting me for a mille
and get back to the rooms, but I wasn't
having any. I worked hard to get her to
look at the lovely night‚Äîhow the moon
shone on the water, how swell a cruise-boat
looked as it passed out to sea all lit up,
how the lights of the fishing boats in the
harbour twinkled. But, I tell you, she was
difficult to hold. And all the time the
minutes were slipping away and nothing
happened. It got to twelve-thirty, and I
thought something must have gone wrong
with all that apparatus they took up into
those steep mountains‚Äîaccident, maybe, or
something. Twelve-forty came, and then
suddenly the quiet of the night was shattered.
A terrible voice roared from the clouds:
'REPENT! REPENT!' and at the same
time the words were repeated in flaming
letters a mile long in the sky.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, boys, I was scared dumb
myself, The voice was really awful. It seemed
to go right through you, and for a moment I
got the appalling notion it must be God
speaking. The Frenchies were scared to
death, as well they might be. They tore out
of the Casino like cattle was stampeding‚Äî
out of all the restaurants and dance halls
they came pouring in a rush and went
flopping on their knees in the square by
hundreds. A terrible sigh rose from the whole
crowd as the voice began to thunder out
again, but I can't tell you what it said, as
I guess it was Italian, and anyway, I was
too scared to take it in.</p>
<p>&quot;Then silence. A silence you could feel.
The sky and the night were empty again‚Äî
just quiet stars and deep blue.</p>
<p>&quot;Was I pleased? I'll say I was, now that
my nerves were steady again. I was right
on a winner, I knew. I was feeling generous,
so I slipped the blonde a couple of notes
and told her to beat it. Believe it or not,
she was still on her knees, but she kind of
regained consciousness when I crackled the
notes by her ear. She stopped praying for a
moment to shove the notes down her dress‚Äî
what there was of it‚Äîand then went at it
again, praying like a loud-speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I left her to it, and walked to the hotel,
treading on air. I felt kind of sorry for all
those punks still praying in the square, as
I mixed myself a high-ball, but I thought
they were a hard-boiled lot and a little spot
of praying couldn't do them any harm. I
guess most of them hadn't prayed for twenty
years, if ever. I got a good laugh when I
thought about Charles, the head waiter.
Not many guys can boast that they've seen
a head waiter pray I Anyway, I would put
it all right with them next day. I'd tell
them it was only a stunt.</p>
<p>&quot;But that's just where I went wrong.
They wouldn't believe me. That's what
shook me about the French, as I mentioned
at the beginning of this story. I had always
thought the French were logical and would
listen to reason, but these Froggies all got
mad as blazes when I told them the truth.
&quot;No, no!' they cried, and whispered, 'It
was God'‚Äîle bon Doo, as they called Him.
Even Charles went on the same way. I
told him after breakfast that I'd bring the
boys round who had worked the stunt, but
he' just smiled in a superior way and, by
God, he had the last laugh, too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? How was that?&quot; cut in some of
his listeners.</p>
<p>&quot;Because those two blasted fools came
down that mountain road in the dark too
fast and had smashed up the lorry and killed
themselves. That's why and how it was.
Can you beat it for bad luck? And that's
why St. Jools still believes in the Miracle
of the Voice, as they call it, and how it got
reformed. They're building a church now
to the Voice. Anyway, the little burg is no
use now to any American citizen who aims
to see Europe!&quot;</p>
<p>Fatty stopped. The black-bearded Frenchman
in the chair beside me was shaking all
over, and when I turned I saw tears running
down his cheeks. Never before or since
have I seen a guy laugh as that Frenchie
laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; I asked him.
&quot;It was a good story. I don't see what's
so terribly funny about it‚Äî&quot;</p>
<p>He wiped his eyes and recovered his breath.
&quot;Well,&quot; he said in a low voice, &quot;you see,
I've heard it before many, many times‚Äî'</p>
<p>&quot;Heard <em>him</em> tell it, you mean?&quot; I asked
in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Mais oui,&quot; he whispered, no longer
laughing now. &quot;He used to tell it every
night three years ago when he was staying
with me‚Äî&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In your house?&quot; I interrupted.</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;I was in charge of him in
the St. Jules Private Lunatic Asylum.&quot;</p>
