<p>If seeing is believing the story, of course, is justified, and stands
foursquare as a fact, for certainly both my cousin and myself saw
the thing as clearly as we saw the village church and the wooded
mountains beyond, which were its background. There may, how-
ever, be other explanations, and my cousin, who is something of
a psychologist, availed himself volubly of the occasion to ride his
pet hobby. He easily riddled the saying that seeing is believing,
while I listened as patiently as possible. Although no psychologist
myself, I knew that the phrase was as inadequate as most other
generalisations. Indeed, there is no commoner act of magic in
daily life than that of sight, by which the mind projects into the
air an image, translated objectively from a sensation in the brain
caused by light irritating the optic nerve. &quot;The picture on the
retina, upside down, anyhow,&quot; he kept telling me afterwards, &quot;is
not the object itself that throws off the light-rays, is it? You never
see the actual object, do you? You're merely playing with an
image, eh? It's pure image-ination, don't you see? It's simple
magic, the magic that everybody denies.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, nothing he could offer by way of explanation
satisfied me. The question form of his sentences, moreover, irritated.
I rather clung to &quot;seeing is believing,&quot; and I think in his
heart he did the same, for all his cloud of words.</p>
<p>It was evening, and the summer dusk was falling, as we
tramped in silence up the hill towards the village where my cousin,
with his wife and children, occupy the upper part of an old chalet.
We had been climbing Jura cliffs all day; it had been arduous,
exciting work, and we both were tired out. Conversation had long
since ceased; our legs moved mechanically, and we both devoutly
wished we were at home. &quot;Ah, there's the cemetery at last,&quot; he
sighed, as the landmark near the village came into view. &quot;Thank
goodness!&quot; and I was too weary even to make the obvious commentary.
The relief of lying down seemed in his mind. With a
grunt by way of reply I glanced carelessly at the rough stone-wall
surrounding the ugly patch cut squarely from the vineyards, and at
the formal pines and larches that stood, plume-like, among the
pleasant graves. &quot;Old m√®re Corbillard is safe and snug in her
last resting-place,&quot; he added, as we passed the painted iron-gate,
&quot;and a good thing too!&quot; There was relief in his tone, but a
moment later there was vivid annoyance. &quot;Izzie,&quot; he cried,
stopping short, &quot;what are you doing again in there? You know
your mother forbade you to go any more. What a naughty, disobedient
child you are!&quot; And he called to his fourteen-year-old
child to come out. She came at once, but listlessly, and not one
whit afraid. He scolded her a little. &quot;I was only putting flowers
on the grave,&quot; she said. Her face wore a puzzled, scared expression,
and the eyes were very bright ‚Äî she had wonderful brown
eyes ‚Äî but it was not her father's chiding that caused the look.</p>
<p>She took our arms with affectionate possession, as her way was,
and we all three laboured up the hill together. No more was said: her
father was too tired to find further fault. &quot;Please don't tell
mother, Daddy, will you?&quot; she whispered, as we reached the chalet
and went in; &quot;I promise faithfully not to go again.&quot; He said
nothing, but I saw him give her a kiss, and I gave her one myself.
The feeling was strong in me that she was frightened and needed
protection. I put my arm tightly round her, giving her a good
warm hug. The pleading, helpless look she gave me in return
I shall not soon forget.</p>
<p>The memory of &quot;old m√®re Corbillard&quot; no one cared to keep
alive ‚Äî the wealthy peasant who had died a week ago. Known as
&quot;la mauvaise riche,&quot; because of her miserly habits, she was also
credited with stealing her neighbours' cats for the purpose of devouring
them ‚Äî &quot;lapin de montagne,&quot; as the natives termed the
horrid dish. Her face was sinister ‚Äî steel-grey eyes, hooked nose,
and prominent teeth ‚Äî and had the village soul been more imaginative
or superstitious, she would certainly have been called a witch.
As it was, she merely passed for &quot;m√©chante&quot; and distinctly
&quot;toqu√©e.&quot; Held in general disfavour, she was avoided and disliked,
and she repaid the hatred well, thanks to her money. She
lived in utter solitude, the one companion, oddly enough, to whom
admittance was never denied, being ‚Äî Izzie. &quot;Oddly enough,&quot; because,
while the old woman was half-imbecile, maliciously imbecile,
the child, on her side ‚Äî to put it kindly ‚Äî was unusually backward
for her age, if not mentally deficient. But Izzie's deficiency
was of mild and gentle quality ‚Äî a sweet child, if ever there was
one. And the parents, while barely tolerating the strange acquaintanceship,
never knew how frequent the visits were. They always
meant to stop the friendship, yet had never done so. Izzie, true
solitary, kept to herself too much. She loved the old woman's
stories. They hesitated to say the final No. Thus, at first, they
let her go to put fresh flowers, which she picked herself, upon the
grave, until, feeling that her too constant journeys there were
morbid, the ultimatum had gone forth that they must stop. &quot;It's
queer that you should care to go so often,&quot; said her father. &quot;It's
not right,&quot; added her mother, the parents exchanging a look that
meant they scented some unholy influence at work. &quot;But I promised
to do it every day,&quot; said Izzie frankly. Then further explanations
elicited the unwelcome addition: &quot;She said she would
come and fetch me if I didn't&quot; ‚Äî and the influence of the old
woman seemed defined. &quot;Ha, ha!&quot; said mother's eyes to father;
&quot;so the old wretch frightened her apparently into the promise,&quot;
and they congratulated themselves that the mischief had been
stopped in time.</p>
<p>The incident was slight enough. The imagination of the backward
child, perhaps a little morbidly inclined owing to her love of
solitude, had been unduly stimulated. It had been gently, wisely
corrected, and the matter was at an end. Yet, somehow, for me,
it lingered in my memory, as though something very vital lay at
the core of it.</p>
<p>There followed forty-eight hours of soaking rain that kept us
all indoors, and after it a day of cloudless sunshine that made
everybody happy. We romped and played with the children, basked
in the delicious heat, and were generally full of active mischief.
Mother, mending stockings and trying to write letters, had a merry
time of it. But joy and forgiveness ruled the day, and one was
ashamed to feel vexation at anything with such a sun in the
heavens. Only Izzie, I noticed, kept apart; she was listless and indifferent,
joining in no games; her thin, pale face, in contrast to the
strange brilliance of her eyes, was evidence to me of some force
busily at work within. But she kept it fairly well concealed; it
seemed natural for her to moon about alone; I think no one else
noticed that her behaviour was more marked than usual. With the
cunning of the slow-witted she avoided me in particular, guessing
that I was ready to make advances. She divined that I understood.
Hiding my purpose as well as possible, I kept her closely under
observation, and after supper, when she strolled off alone down the
road between the vineyards, I called to Daddy to come and have a
pipe. We followed her. The moment we caught her up she turned
and took her place as usual, an arm to each. How tall she seemed;
she almost topped her father. She kept silence, merely walking in
step with us, and holding us rather close I thought, as though glad
of our presence though she had started off alone. At first
Daddy made efforts to draw her into conversation ‚Äî efforts that
failed utterly. For my part, I let her be, content to keep her arm
firmly in my own, for there was very strong in me the feeling that I
must protect and watch, guarding her from something that she
feared yet was unable to resist. We talked across her, I guiding
the conversation towards fun, and she was so tall that we had to
stoop and lean forward to see each other's faces.</p>
<p>Hot sun had dried the road up, and the evening was still and
peaceful. We paced slowly to and fro, turning always at the village
fountain, and again at the crest of the hill where the descent
went steeply towards the cemetery. And here, at each turning
Izzie lingered a moment and looked down the hill. I felt perceptibly
the dragging on my arm. Once, at the fountain, I made to follow
the road through the village. &quot;No,&quot; said the child, with decision
I disliked intensely. &quot;let's go back again,&quot; and we obeyed meekly.
&quot;Little tyrant,&quot; said her unobservant father.</p>
<p>The mountains rose in a wall of purple shadow, their ridges
outlined against a fading sky of gold and crimson. Thin columns
of peat smoke traced their scaffolding across it faintly, then melted
out. From time to time a group of labourers from the vineyards
passed us, singing the Dalcroze songs, taking their hats off, and
saying &quot;Bon soir, bonne nuit.&quot; We knew them all. Izzie
watched them go ‚Äî with almost feverish interest. I got the queer
impression she was waiting till the last group had gone home. She
certainly was waiting for something; there was a covert expectancy
in her manner that stirred my former uneasiness. And this uneasiness
grew stronger every minute. I could hardly listen to my
cousin's desultory talk. At last I brought things suddenly to a
head, for it was more than my nerves could stand. Abruptly I
stood still. The other two, linked arm-in-arm stood with me.</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; I said sharply, &quot;let's go in,&quot; and was going to add
peremptorily, &quot;Take Izzie with you,&quot; when the words died away on
my lips and the tongue in my mouth went dry. My blood seemed
turned to ice. For a second I stood in rigid paralysis. For the
figure between us, she whose arms were linked to ours, was not
Izzie, but another. A gaunt, lean face peered close into my own
through the dusk as I stooped to see my cousin, and the eyes were
of cold steel grey instead of brown. The skin was lined and furrowed,
and projecting teeth of an aged woman gleamed faintly
below the great hooked nose. It was m√®re Corbillard who stood
between us, hanging her withered hands upon our arms, her sinister
face so close that her straggling thin grey hair even touched our
shoulders.</p>
<p>The dreadful sight was as vividly defined as the white face of
my cousin which I saw the same instant just beyond: and by his
ghastly pallor, and the water in his eyes, I knew that he had seen
her too. His lips were parted, his right hand was raised and
clenched. I thought he was going to strike, but instead, wrenching
himself violently free, he sprang to one side with an expression of
horror that was more a cry than actual words. There was a shriek;
whose I dare not say; it may have been my own for all my scattered
senses can remember. To this day what I recall was the sensation
of death upon my arm, and the glare of those steely eyes that peered
triumphantly into my own ‚Äî then a momentary darkness.</p>
<p>All happened in less than a second. The figure had broken loose
from between us, and was racing down the road like a flying
shadow ‚Äî towards the cemetery. Yet the figure we watched an
instant before starting in frantic pursuit was unmistakably ‚Äî Izzie.</p>
<p>To my cousin belongs the reward of prompt action and recapture.
We simply flew. And he caught the child long before
she reached the forbidden gates. Weeping, white and frightened,
we half carried her indoors, and explained to her alarmed mother
that she had been taken suddenly ill, <em>crise de nerfs</em>, as Daddy,
with presence of mind, described it. It was not the first time; Izzie
had been too often hysterical to cause undue anxiety. Mother will
never know the truth unless she reads this story, which is unlikely,
since her mending and darning leave her little leisure for newspapers.
My cousin and myself have discussed the thing <em>ad
nauseam</em>, and, as I have indicated, he explained it in a variety of
ways. But neither of us know what Izzie thought or felt. We,
of course, dared not ask her, and the child has never volunteered a
word. That she was severely frightened only is clear. She never
passes the cemetery alone now, and the name of old m√®re Corbillard
has not passed her lips a single time. My cousin's discovery of
the horror, however, coincided with my own. Comparing notes
proved that. He had been aware of no uneasy sensations previously
as I had been. Telepathy, therefore, was the clue he
finally decided on. &quot;It covers more ground than that word 'possession'
and has besides,&quot; as he said &quot;a sort of scientific sound.&quot;</p>
